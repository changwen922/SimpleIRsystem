Minsk (CNN)Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko denied Monday that state repression exists in Belarus, while answering questions from local and foreign media. He also invited members of the public to ask questions during the press conference in Minsk. "Using repressions in Belarus would be akin to shooting oneself," Lukashenko said, as he faced questions about the violent crackdown on protesters following last year's disputed presidential election. In response to a question on repression and the imprisonment of political opponents, Lukashenko accused the US of "lawlessness," citing the January 6 insurrection and invoking false claims about the US presidential election result.

Lukashenko said.
