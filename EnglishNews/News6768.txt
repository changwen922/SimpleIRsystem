 (CNN)Barcelona may be without a new permanent manager but the Catalan club still scraped past Dynamo Kyiv 1-0 in the Champions League on Tuesday. Ansu Fati's thunderbolt in the second-half ensured the visitor took all three crucial points to boost its chances of qualifying for the knockout stages. Incredibly, it was Bar√ßa's first away win of the season after a string of poor performances which subsequently saw previous manager Ronald Koeman sacked. The Catalan club's caretaker coach Sergi Barjuan has taken charge while the blaugrana confirm Koeman's replacement, with reports that former player Xavi is lined up to fill the void. "We all knew that we had to win at any cost. The players were nervous before the game and you look at them now and their faces are different. Winning always helps and I hope we keep momentum for the next game," Barjuan told reporters.
