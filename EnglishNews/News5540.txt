London (CNN)With the Duchess of Sussex's photograph plastered across many UK newspapers this week, you'd have been forgiven for thinking you'd somehow time-traveled back to 2019.Reminiscent of the peak media frenzy that engulfed Meghan, this week saw the latest bout in her two-year legal battle against the publisher of the Mail on Sunday.To refresh memories: The duchess brought a case against Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) back in 2019 for publishing excerpts of a "private" letter that she had sent to her estranged father, Thomas Markle, the year before. She was seeking damages for misuse of private information, copyright infringement and breach of the Data Protection Act 2018. The UK's High Court ruled in Meghan's favor earlier this year, issuing a summary judgement, which avoided a full trial. Now, ANL is challenging that February ruling in the UK Court of Appeal, saying the litigation should have gone to trial, according to the UK's PA Media news agency.The Sussexes got all glammed up for The Intrepid Museum's Salute to Freedom Gala on November 10 in New York. The furor this week erupted as revelations in court appeared to undermine some of the arguments previously presented by Meghan's lawyers. Meghan and Harry's former communications secretary, Jason Knauf, alleged in a witness statement released on Wednesday that the duchess crafted the message to her father with the forethought that it could get leaked, PA reported.Read MorePA reported Knauf as saying in his written evidence that he exchanged correspondence with the duchess in which they discussed an early draft of the letter and that Meghan had responded to him: "Obviously everything I have drafted is with the understanding that it could be leaked so I have been meticulous in my word choice, but please do let me know if anything stands out for you as a liability."File photograph of Jason Knauf in November 2018Knauf, pictured above, served as the communications secretary to the Sussexes until March 2019 and now works for William and Kate as chief executive of their Royal Foundation.Meghan responded to the claims in her own written statement and rejected the argument that she believed her father would release the letter, saying she "merely recognised that this was a possibility."She said the thinking behind penning the letter to her father, upon consultation with two unnamed senior royal family members, was to urge him to stop engaging with the media. "To be clear, I did not want any of it to be published, and wanted to ensure that the risk of it being manipulated or misleadingly edited was minimised, were it to be exploited," PA reported the duchess as saying.Meghan also apologized for forgetting emails she had exchanged with Knauf over a briefing he was giving to authors of an unauthorized biography about her and Prince Harry, after he revealed her awareness in his statement. The Sussexes had previously repeatedly denied collaborating with Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand on their book "Finding Freedom."Copies of "Finding Freedom" in a London bookstoreCritics argue the apology hits the couple's credibility in their fight for privacy from the press and their very public battle against misinformation, and the disclosures inevitably sparked headlines. Tabloids pounced on the slightest whiff of apparent impropriety by the royal with biting headlines like "Little Miss Forgetful" and "I'm sorry, I forgot."However, CNN's historian and royal expert Kate Williams said she didn't think the developments were particularly damaging and that the story was unlikely to be registering in people's consciousness in the UK. "I think that lots of people probably find this quite legal, technical discussions so I don't think it's damaging."She added, "The fact is that Meghan has said she did ask her secretary to brief the authors but forgot about it and she didn't mislead the court. It was something that slipped her mind in general discussions they had about dealing with the media."British women's rights activist and lawyer Shola Mos-Shogbamimu argued that Meghan's apology wouldn't have affected the ruling from earlier this year as the case centers on whether ANL breached her privacy by printing the letter. She said in a post on Twitter that the duchess was right to apologize, "but remember she won her case on its merits.""Whether or not she approved context via Knauf for Finding Freedom would've made zero difference to Court granting her victory on privacy," Mos-Shogbamimu wrote.The couple visited service members and their spouses at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey on Thursday.Nick Goldstone, head of dispute resolution at international law firm Ince, told CNN that any repercussions from Meghan's statement over the apology "all depends on the attitude of the court and the significance of the mistake, the context of that mistake in the overall scheme of the case and the extent of any apology."Whether the developments are a turning point in the case ultimately remains up to the judges in the appeals court, who are due to deliver their ruling at a later date."The appeal court has a wide discretion," Goldstone said, noting that the original decision was made without the case proceeding to trial. "So the appeal court could remit the case to proceed to trial or dismiss the appeal," he said, adding that it could even make some other ruling altogether.IN THE ROYAL DIARYQueen Elizabeth at Ascot Racecourse on October 16Queen Elizabeth II will attend her first public engagement since being advised to rest by doctors almost two weeks ago, Buckingham Palace has confirmed.
