 (CNN)European football governing body UEFA found itself on the defensive over diversity ahead of the Euro 2020 match between Germany and Hungary on Wednesday.It started with a proposal by the Munich city council to illuminate the Allianz Arena in rainbow colors for the game -- a response to an anti-LGBTQ law passed by the Hungarian parliament last week. UEFA declined the request, citing its "political context." But opposition to that decision snowballed ahead of the game."It's true, the football pitch is not about politics. It's about people, about fairness, about tolerance," German foreign minister Heiko Maas tweeted on Wednesday."That's why UEFA is sending the wrong signal. But fortunately you can still show your colors today -- in the stadium and outside #loveislove."Read MoreGermany secures impressive victory against Portugal at Euro 2020Around 20,000 rainbow-colored flags were distributed at the Allianz Arena ahead of the game, while many spectators attending the match dressed in rainbow-colored clothes.
