Title race enthralls New fans are important but getting them to stick with the sport is critical. This year's constant action on the track anchored by the Hamilton-Verstappen title fight has satisfied the second part of that equation. Eyes across the globe will be on all 58 laps in Abu Dhabi on Sunday, the final race to determine who takes home the title. Up until the last lap, every second of the season has been and will be a nail biter.All the variables that brought the two drivers to tally the same exact score heading into the finale is what kept fans' attention throughout the season. Think Verstappen's car perched on top of Hamilton's after the crash in Monza or the smoke rising forebodingly from Hamilton's brakes seconds before the restart in Baku. Verstappen's car ended up on top of Hamilton's at the Italian Grand Prix in September.The best racing is when the two are at it, wheel-to-wheel, like they were through the opening laps of the British Grand Prix.Sprint Qualifying, a format introduced to three weekends this season was seen across the community as a controversial addition to the sport.

Part of that is built-in because F1 is a global sport with just over 20 events a year. Those constraints make attending a race weekend expensive. For American fans eager to make it to a race, there is some good news: a race in Miami next season means two races in the US for the first time since 1984.After the exciting culmination of this season comes the anticipation for the next, with new car designs and some changes in the driver lineup. Season four of "Drive to Survive" is imminent too. All of that adds up to a feeling that there is so much more to come from the sport.
