 (CNN)Pope Francis has dedicated a large part of his traditional Christmas message on Saturday to reflect on the pandemic and its impact on relationships.Speaking from the balcony overlooking St. Peter's Square in the Vatican, the Pontiff called the pandemic a "complex crisis" that has tested social relationships and increased tendencies of withdrawal."Our capacity for social relationships is sorely tired," Francis told the people in the square as well as the millions of Catholics watching the address from around the world. "There is a growing tendency to withdraw, to do it all by ourselves, to stop making an effort to encounter others and do things together," he added.The Pope's traditional "Urbi et Orbi" or "To the City and the World" Christmas address was affected by the pandemic for the second year running.

The country reported a record-breaking 50,599 new Covid-19 cases on Friday, the highest daily figure since the pandemic began, according to health ministry data.Last year, the Pope delivered the address from the Apostolic Palace instead of the balcony, with the public not allowed to attend. On Christmas Eve, the Pope led a vigil mass in St. Peter's Basilica with about 2,000 people in attendance, Holy See Press Office Director Matteo Bruni told CNN.The Pope said on Saturday that the pandemic has also affected dialogue, in relation to international conflict, leading people to take "shortcuts rather than setting out on the longer paths" for talks."Sisters and brothers, what would our world be like without the patient dialogue of the many generous persons who keep families and communities together?
