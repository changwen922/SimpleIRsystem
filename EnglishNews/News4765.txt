Medvedev bats away boosRead MoreWith Medvedev serving for his first major title at 40-15 in the third set, jeers could be heard amongst the din at the Arthur Ashe Stadium.The 25-year-old proceeded to double fault, sparking jubilant roars among the New York crowd, but Medvedev swiftly collected himself to win the following point and secure the title."Wow, that was special," Medvedev told CNN's Carolyn Manno when asked about the partisan atmosphere."As soon as we went on the court, it was different to all the matches I played here before. You felt it was a special, special night, special evening, more for him and the crowd going for him and they tried so hard to get him on."They definitely didn't want to disturb me on purpose, I doubt it, but of course before the second serve you get the screams, you make double fault, and the whole crowd goes crazy -- it's really tough."I know I have to focus on myself and how do I win this match, and again I managed to do it so that's all that matters," he added.Medvedev reacts to his win against Djokovic at the US Open.No stranger to playing the villain in New York, Medvedev's tolerant reaction was a far cry from his response to boos at the US Open two years ago, when the Russian was subsequently fined for unsportsmanlike conduct and a visible obscenity during his victory over Spain's Feliciano Lopez. As he was continuously booed throughout his post-match interview, Medvedev waved his encouragement and told the crowd: "I won because of you." Yet the clues to his more accepting reaction were evident in comments made to CNN before this year's tournament, as Medvedev admitted he had learned his "lessons" from that explosive 2019 experience.'I'm sorry': Medvedev feels for tearful DjokovicDjokovic too has been on the end of jeers at the venue in the past, but there was only overwhelming love for the Serb this time round.Six years ago during his triumph over Roger Federer, Djokovic found himself as the firm second favorite of the New York crowd, but was roared on throughout in his pursuit of a record 21st grand slam against Medvedev.Sat in his chair at 5-4 in the third set, an immense swell of encouragement saw an emotional Djokovic shed tears as he covered his face with his towel before returning to the baseline.
