London (CNN)Prince Philip, the late husband to the UK's Queen Elizabeth II, will be laid to rest on Saturday next week, in a ceremony that will be colorful and steeped in tradition, but low key by royal standards. Philip, who was officially the Duke of Edinburgh, died peacefully at Windsor Castle on Friday morning at the age of 99. He was the nation's longest-serving consort -- a term given to the spouse of a reigning monarch -- and they had been married for 73 years.Harry, the Duke of Sussex, will attend his grandfather's funeral, but his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, won't be present, a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said. The couple are living in California and a doctor had advised the duchess, who is pregnant, against traveling to the UK, the spokesperson said.

The procession will begin at 2:45 p.m. (9:45 a.m. ET) and will be led from Windsor Castle by a band of grenadier guards, along with several heads of military units. A Royal Navy piping party will pipe "The Still" whilst the Land Rover is stationed at the foot of the West Steps. There will be a gun salute and a national minute's silence at 3 p.m. ahead of the ceremony.  The duke's death has been marked in a somber fashion, as the royal household and UK government have asked the public not to gather or leave flowers at royal residences, with the country still under strict Covid-19 restrictions.

He was an environmentalist, and a champion of the natural world, long before it was fashionable," Johnson said. But the duke was also a controversial figure. For many Britons, his defining characteristic was not his public service but his off-the-cuff and often offensive comments, including some that were undeniably racist.The BBC said Friday it was receiving complaints about too much air time dedicated to the duke's death, after the public broadcaster canceled hours of its usual programming to make way for wall-to-wall coverage of Philip's life and death.The BBC set up a dedicated feedback form within hours of the news from Buckingham Palace because of the high volume of complaints.The special coverage had meant some of the UK's most-watched shows, including soap opera EastEnders and the final of cooking competition MasterChef, were taken off air.People gather outside the gates of Buckingham Palace in London on Saturday.But the nation is officially in eight days of mourning, as was announced on Friday, and there will be other tributes to the duke in public life.

He was seen in public only infrequently from that point, notably at the Windsor Castle wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in May 2018, and at the nuptials for Princess Eugenie in October 2018 and for Princess Beatrice in July 2020.CNN's Lauren Moorhouse, James Frater, Lindsay Isaac and David Wilkinson contributed to this report.
