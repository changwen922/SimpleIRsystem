Rome (CNN)Italian officials have arrested three people on manslaughter charges over a fatal cable car accident in northern Italy Sunday which left 14 people dead.The men "have admitted to what happened," Carabiniere Lieutenant Colonel Alberto Cicognani claimed in an interview with CNN affiliate Skytg24 Wednesday morning.According to Cicognani, the suspects said in their interrogation overnight that the cable car's emergency brakes had been malfunctioning in the days leading up to Sunday's accident. They told investigators that the brakes were activating when they were not supposed to and so were causing the car to stop while carrying passengers on board.  The cabin's wreckage covered with a tarpaulin on Wednesday.Cicognani said a decision was made to deactivate the emergency brake after a maintenance company was unable to fix the problem.  That decision meant "the emergency brake could not be activated, and this is why when the cable snapped, the car precipitated backwards," he added.
