The 25-year-old won bronze medals in the 10,000m at the 2017 and 2019 World Championships and finished 4th in the 5,000m at the Tokyo Games. Last month, Tirop made history by taking 28 seconds off the long-standing, women-only world record for 10km at the Adizero Road To Records event in Germany. Tirop finished in a time of 30:01, breaking the previous record of 30:29, which had been set by Moroccan Asmae Leghzaoui in 2002. Following the race, she said, "I'm so happy to have broken the world record. I felt the pace was good. The course was very good, too."At the 2015 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, Tirop became the second-youngest ever gold medalist in the women's race after Zola Budd. Athletics Kenya said the country had "lost a jewel who was one of the fastest-rising athletics giants on the international stage, thanks to her eye-catching performances."Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta also paid tribute, saying in a statement: "It is unsettling, utterly unfortunate and very sad that we've lost a young and promising athlete who, at a young age of 25 years, she had brought our country so much glory through her exploits on the global athletics stage including in this year's 2020 Tokyo Olympics where she was part of the Kenyan team in Japan."
