"However, it was not like that, after a few episodes we became disunited and many things did not work. Andrea Pirlo has struggled since taking over as Juventus head coach."I knew we were going to run into difficulties, but now we all have to get out of this together. There must always be pride in wearing this shirt and certain performances must not be there. I had a different project in mind, I tried to work according to certain principles, at times we had to adapt, but I am convinced that I have an excellent team at my disposal. "If something went wrong, I take responsibility for it."The season isn't over entirely, however, with the Coppa Italia final still to play against Atalanta on May 19.Ronaldo's current contract runs until the end of next season, but there have been reports the 36-year-old is keen to return to Sporting. However, Juventus managing director Fabio Paratici insisted earlier this year that the club would be "holding on to him," despite its struggles on the pitch.
