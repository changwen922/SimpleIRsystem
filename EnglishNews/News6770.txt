 (CNN)I've been a meteorologist at CNN since 1999. And for a long time I didn't think that global warming gasses would overwhelm the earth enough to change its climate. As a skeptic, I didn't deny climate change existed. I was questioning the data behind the science. One big number ultimately changed my mind.

This fact changed my mind 00:51That was on April 23, 2013. After that day I started attending climate conferences, and continued to consume more and more of the data coming in about climate change. I like to say that I didn't go from denier to believer; I went from skeptic to scholar. And along the way I learned a lot about the climate crisis that I hope will help YOU better understand it as well.

These greenhouse gasses are just as bad 01:26Over the last millennium, the concentration of these gasses in the atmosphere has gone up and down. In tandem, global temperatures have also become warmer, colder and then warmer again. That's why so many skeptics say climate change is cyclical, and point to that as evidence against global warming. But what we're experiencing now is much more extreme than in the past:JUST WATCHEDClimate change is cyclical, but this is worseReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHClimate change is cyclical, but this is worse 01:19As this alarming rate of warming continues, it is evident that humans are responsible.
