 (CNN)The All Blacks, the New Zealand men's rugby team, have canceled two tests against South Africa and a match against Australia because of Covid-19 travel restrictions. New Zealand is currently under lockdown restrictions until at least Tuesday at 11:59 p.m. local after discovering an outbreak of the highly transmissible Delta variant of the coronavirus in the country. Authorities have since uncovered another 30 active cases, including 11 locally transmitted infections that were announced on Friday.The team were scheduled to face the Wallabies -- the Australia men's rugby team -- this Saturday in Perth, Australia, for the third Bledisloe Cup Test match -- a series between the two nations -- and the nation's second match of the Rugby Championship, a test series contested between New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and Argentina. However, "given the current uncertainty over The Rugby Championship schedule," according to a statement from New Zealand Rugby (NZR), the team will not travel. NZR CEO Mark Robinson said the decision was made because of the inability to assure the team's return to home.

Robinson said every effort had been made to keep the tests in New Zealand."We share the disappointment of our fans, players and other stakeholders, particularly those in Dunedin where the sold-out 100th Test between the All Blacks and South Africa was shaping up as a very special occasion," he said."However, after discussions with Government, it is clear that the Covid-19 travel restrictions meant there was no way of bringing the South African and Wallaroos squads into New Zealand and we understand the importance of putting the health and safety of New Zealanders first."Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosOfficial match balls are seen ahead of The Rugby Championship and Bledisloe Cup match between the All Blacks and the Wallabies.Rugby Australia CEO Andy Marinos criticized the lack of communication from his New Zealand counterparts, saying he was "bloody angry.""I think it's disappointing how it has been communicated.
