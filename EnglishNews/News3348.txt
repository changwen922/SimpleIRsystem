 (CNN)Manchester City suffered a double blow on Wednesday as manager Pep Guardiola said he plans to leave the club in 2023 as Spurs striker Harry Kane announced he is staying at the London team.The prospect of Kane moving to City came to a screeching halt on Wednesday as the England captain announced on Twitter that he would be staying at the club he's spent the majority of his career at."It was incredible to see the reception from the Spurs fans on Sunday and to read some of the messages of support I've had in the last few weeks," Kane wrote in a social media post on Wednesday,"I will be staying at Tottenham this summer and will be 100% focused on helping the team achieve success."Kane -- whose contract at Spurs runs until 2024 -- had previously said he'd like to leave this summer, and believed he had a gentleman's agreement with chairman Daniel Levy make that happen.Read MoreHowever, Levy refused to budge on reported $200 million asking price. Having already signed Jack Grealish for £100m, Manchester City seemed unwilling to stump up that sum. After not turning up for scheduled training and coronavirus tests, Kane then missed the first two games of the season, before finally making his first appearance on Sunday, coming on as a substitute in Spurs' 1-0 Premier League win over Wolves.READ: French top-flight league match abandoned after fans invade pitch and clash with playersKane during the Premier League match between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Tottenham Hotspur.The end of an era?Meanwhile Guardiola said he plans to leave the club when his current contract runs out in 2023.The Spaniard, who joined the club in 2016, feels he will need a rest after seven years at the helm."After seven years at this team, I think I'm going to have a stop," said Guardiola, who was peaking at an online event organized by Brazilian financial services company XP Investimentos, and quoted by ESPN Brasil."I will have a break, see what we've done.
