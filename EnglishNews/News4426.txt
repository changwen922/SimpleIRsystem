"Everyone was a melting pot, and I noticed that as soon as I walked into the world of cricket, the comments started. "I had comments about where I grew up, and the fact that I had a long name, maybe my mum didn't know who my dad was; about my hair, body parts, especially the derriere shall we say; about the food that I ate and that it stank."I question myself why I stayed so long. I love the game, it has so much more to offer, but it can be really difficult dealing with that day in and day out."
