Paris (CNN)French Catholic clergy could have abused at least 10,000 minors and other vulnerable people since 1950, according to an independent investigation set up by the Church in France.The Independent Commission on Sexual Abuse in the Church (CIASE) "estimates that the number of victims could reach 'at least ten thousand,'" it said in a statement released on Monday. The commission said it had so far received 6,500 testimonies, which concern at least 3,000 different victims.Jean-Marc Sauv√©, the president of the CIASE, said it is not known at this stage what percentage of all victims have testified to the commission."It is very possible that the victims will reach at least the number of 10,000. The work in progress, and in particular the survey of the general population, will make it possible to specify the number," he said.Read MoreThe commission was set up in 2018 by the French Catholic Church hierarchy and religious institutes after abuse scandals came to light.It is financed by the French Catholic Bishops conference, but members are not paid and do not receive instructions from the Church.
