 (CNN)Australian tennis star Nick Kyrgios has confirmed his withdrawal from the Tokyo Olympics, saying a ban on spectators attending the Games was a factor behind his decision.Games organisers announced on Thursday that Tokyo venues for the pandemic-delayed event will not host spectators due to the city's coronavirus state of emergency.The new state of emergency for the capital will run from July 12 to August 22 -- covering the 16 days of the embattled Games in its entirety.In a statement posted on Twitter, Kyrgios wrote: "It's a decision I didn't make lightly. It's been my dream to represent Australia at the Olympics and I know I may never get that opportunity again."But I also know myself. The thought of playing in front of empty stadiums just doesn't sit right with me. It never has."Read MoreAustralia's Nick Kyrgios falls as he returns to France's Ugo Humbert during their men's singles first round match on the third day of the 2021 Wimbledon Championships.READ: Six years after his grandmother passed away, Nick Kyrgios grapples with demonsThere are a total of 42 venues listed on the Tokyo 2020 website.
