Minsk, Belarus (CNN)Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has refused to apologize for the widespread human rights violations in the country since his disputed re-election last year in an exclusive interview with CNN. CNN cited evidence from Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International of some detainees reporting injuries including broken bones and burns, while others said they were forced to lie naked in dirt while being assaulted.Lukashenko responded: "You know, we don't have a single detention center, as you say, like Guantanamo, or those bases that the United States and your country created in Eastern Europe ... As regards our own detention centers, where we keep those accused or those under investigation, they are no worse than in Britain or the United States. I can guarantee you that."Lukashenko has been president of Belarus since 1994 and is known in some circles as "Europe's last dictator."JUST WATCHEDTop EU official accuses Lukashenko of exploiting migrantsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTop EU official accuses Lukashenko of exploiting migrants 10:17Presidential elections last year were met with widespread protests across the country from a growing opposition movement.
