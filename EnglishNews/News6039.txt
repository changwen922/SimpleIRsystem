Your brother made a dirty play first. If you want to make a step further be sure we will be waiting for you!!"Marcus Morris was later advised by his mom to stay off social media. Momma said don't talk on social media no more! Well There you have it. I love you momma.â€” Marcus Morris (@MookMorris2) November 9, 2021 "This whole thing could have been a whole lot uglier if Markieff was actually facing Jokic," Miami head coach Erik Spoelstra told reporters about the incident. "The fact that he had his back turned and he made a play like that, blindsiding him, that's just a very dangerous play."Morris lies on the ground after being pushed by Jokic.
