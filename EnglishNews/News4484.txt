"This is the most valuable outline of our country for all of us," Pavelko wrote.

"And all of Ukraine, from Sevastopol and Simferopol to Kiev, from Donetsk and Luhansk to Uzhhorod, will support them in every game," he added.The shirt will also feature the slogan "Glory to Ukraine" on the back, and "Glory to the heroes" inside the collar.Zakharova criticized the inclusion of the phrases, which she connected to Ukrainian nationalists who fought alongside the Nazis in WWII."Kiev is apparently seeking to distance this slogan from its uncomfortable origin and fill it with a new positive meaning to make the entire world take it as a progressive one," she said.On Monday, Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba praised the new team shirt on Twitter."I really like the new form of our team," he tweeted. "I can say one thing to all those who started hissing at it because the internationally recognized borders or the official greeting of our state cut their eyes: We will not allow our national symbols to be insulted.
