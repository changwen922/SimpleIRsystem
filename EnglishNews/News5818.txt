 (CNN)The World Cup qualifier between Brazil and Argentina was suspended minutes after kick-off at the Corinthians Arena in São Paulo, Brazil after Brazilian health officials came onto the pitch and escorted multiple Argentinian soccer players away. The Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (Anvisa) had requested support from the country's Federal Police to prevent four Argentinian players from participating in the qualifier, saying that the players in question made false statements upon arriving in Brazil, omitting that they had been in the UK in the past 14 days. According to Brazilian Covid-19 regulations, any passenger who visited the UK 14 days before arrival cannot enter the country."Anvisa considers the situation as a serious health risk, and therefore advised the local health authorities to determine the immediate quarantine of players, who are prevented from participating in any activity and must be prevented from remaining in Brazilian territory," the organization said in a statement.According to CNN affiliate CNN Brasil, Anvisa asked for the deportation of Emiliano Martínez, Emiliano Buendía, Giovani Lo Celso and Cristian Romero -- all English Premier League players.Read MoreREAD: Lionel Messi tells CNN he believes PSG is the best place for him to win UCL again"Due to the decision of the game's referee, the match organized by FIFA between Brazil and Argentina for the World Cup qualifiers is suspended," CONMEBOL announced via Twitter.CONMEBOL continued, "The referee and the match delegate will raise a report to FIFA's Disciplinary Committee, which will determine the steps to follow.
