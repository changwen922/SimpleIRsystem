The clashes near the European Commission headquarters came after Belgium on Wednesday tightened its coronavirus restrictions -- including broadening mask use and working from home -- amid surging cases.Neighboring France is also experiencing a rise in Covid-19 infection rates, though President Emmanuel Macron has said a lockdown of the unvaccinated is "not necessary" given the country's use of a "health pass" to access a wide variety of establishments.Elsewhere Austria on Monday became the first European Union country to go back into full lockdown this autumn amid a record number of cases. Last week Austria's seven-day incidence rate passed 1,000 per 1000,000 inhabitants for the first time during the pandemic, according to the Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety (AGES).Austria now plans to become the first European nation to make Covid-19 vaccinations mandatory for all eligible people from February 1, according to its Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg.In a desperate attempt to encourage people to get their jabs, Austria's public broadcaster ORF said Monday it is offering a "vaccination lottery" to eligible residents -- with prizes including a family house, an electric car and smart TVs.Austria announces Europe's first nationwide vaccine mandate and reimposes lockdown as Covid-19 soars Austria is not alone.

Last week the country imposed a midnight curfew on bars, restaurants and nightclubs as it faces a fresh wave of Covid-19 infections.While the European Union as a whole has been a world leader on inoculations -- more than 76% of adults are fully vaccinated, according to the ECDC -- the rollout has been extremely unequal across the bloc. On the eastern side, Romania and Bulgaria have fully vaccinated only 43% and 29% of their adults, respectively.A CNN team last week witnessed dozens of bodies in black plastic bags piled up in corridors of one hospital in Bucharest as the facility struggled with the influx of deaths caused by the virus.Medical workers and officials in Romania attribute the low vaccination rate to a variety of factors, including suspicion of the authorities, deeply held religious beliefs, and a flood of misinformation surging through social media.Protests turn violent  Fresh Covid-19 restrictions sparked violent protests across some European cities at the weekend, as many citizens face the prospect of their second Christmas under lockdown.
