They have no resources and they have no one to turn to."In May, the #GivingTuesday organization launched #GivingTuesdayNow as an emergency response to the pandemic, but the need remains great worldwide."I think we're all suffering in a collective way, and I think #GivingTuesday will actually be extra special this year because we can respond to that collective, universal suffering with universal generosity," said Asha Curran, CEO of #GivingTuesday."While we celebrate charitable giving, #GivingTuesday is not a fundraising day," Curran explained. "It's a day of generosity and we celebrate generosity in all of the many ways that it manifests, both monetarily and non-monetarily."Here is how you can make a difference this #GivingTuesday.Make a donation or start a fundraiserThroughout our communities, nonprofit organizations are working tirelessly to make a difference.

His nonprofit, like most, relies heavily on the efforts of volunteers for projects.You can connect with nonprofits in your community or use VolunteerMatch or Points of Light to locate both virtual and in-person opportunities near you. You might want to consider creating a mutual aid network. This is a type of self-organized volunteerism that connects those who want to help to those in need. During the pandemic, these types of groups have thrived across the country.For all volunteer opportunities, please keep in mind the safety recommendations outlined by the CDC.Lend your voiceYou have the power to transform your community by lending your voice to advocate for the causes and issues you care about.  "There's so much power in people using their collective voice to inspire generosity," said Curran.You can start a forum to discuss and address community issues, tweet support for your favorite nonprofit or even send thank you notes to those making an impact. "I think that that brings a lot of hope and inspiration and optimism to people," Curran said.
