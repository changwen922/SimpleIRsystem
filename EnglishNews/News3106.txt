The Queen ascended to the throne in 1952 and became the country's longest-serving monarch six years ago. She will be 96 when she completes the seventh decade of her reign, a milestone which officially falls on February 6. Royal celebrations are typically postponed until the summer to allow for better weather.She became a widow in April when her husband, Prince Philip, died aged 99. Next year's Jubilee will be her first without Philip. Official royal events have been scrapped or scaled down since last March, when the UK first entered lockdown. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that rules could virtually return to normal later this month, but a recent rise in cases in the country has thrown those plans into uncertainty.
