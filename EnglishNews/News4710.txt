 (CNN)South African cricketer Quinton de Kock has made the "personal decision" not to take a knee before games at the ongoing T20 World Cup. His decision comes after the Cricket South Africa (CSA) board announced that all players would be required to take a knee before World Cup games in the United Arab Emirates.The 28-year-old de Kock did not feature in South Africa's game against the West Indies on Tuesday."This is also the global gesture against racism that has been adopted by sportspeople across sporting codes because they recognise the power of sport to bring people together," said a statement from CSA."After considering all relevant issues, including the freedom of choice of players, the Board had made it clear it was imperative for the team to be seen taking a stand against racism, especially given SA's history."Read MoreSouth Africa instituted its apartheid policy -- a system of racial segregation enforced by the ruling White minority -- in 1948. The system was not formally dismantled until 1994."The Board's view was that while diversity can and should find expression in many facets of daily lives, this did not apply when it came to taking a stand against racism," added the CSA statement.Quinton de Kock walks from the field after being dismissed against Australia.READ: Indian captain Kohli vows to rectify mistakes after T20 World Cup loss to PakistanThe statement added that the CSA board is awaiting a further report from team management in light of de Kock's decision.The wicketkeeper also declined to kneel when South Africa played West Indies earlier this year, saying at the time: "My reason? I'll keep it to myself. It's my own, personal opinion. It's everyone's decision; no one's forced to do anything, not in life. That's the way I see things."
