It also paid homage to some iconic moments from his glittering career, all framed in the iconic No. 10 he used to wear, in particular the wonder goal he scored against England in the 1986 World Cup. Read MoreArgentina was making its first major tournament appearance since Maradona's passing, and in its game against Chile, it paid the perfect tribute to him, with Lionel Messi -- seen as Maradona's heir -- scoring a glorious free-kick. With 33 minutes played and the scores level, Messi curled home from just outside the box, with goalkeeper Claudio Bravo unable to stop it from nestling in the corner. It was Messi's 73rd international goal. However, despite missing star attacker Alexis Sanchez, Chile came on strong in the second half, winning a penalty 12 minutes after the break. Aston Villa keeper Emiliano Martinez was able to tip Arturo Vidal's attempt onto the bar, only for Eduardo Vargas to head home the rebound. Although the draw extends Argentina's unbeaten run to 14 games under coach Lionel Scaloni, it would have been hoping for a stronger start to its Copa Am√©rica campaign. "This match got complicated for us," Messi said afterwards. "We needed to be calm, have control of possession and play more quickly. The penalty changed the match, too."
