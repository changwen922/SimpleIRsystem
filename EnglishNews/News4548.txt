Naomi Osaka reflects on her tennis career after 'seeing the state of the world'It comes as the four-time grand slam champion continues easing herself back into the sport after taking a break to protect her mental health. After withdrawing from Roland Garros, she revealed she had been dealing with anxiety and bouts of depression and says she found it difficult speaking to the media during tournaments. "I felt like I learned a lot from this match today, and if anything to take away from this, I tried my best throughout the entire match, so I can sleep at night," she added.

Osaka will hope to rediscover her form in time for the US Open on August 30, where she is a two-time champion.
