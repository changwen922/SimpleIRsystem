Their father, Ramadan, returned to Libya in 2011 after rebels overthrew the government. His wife joined him in early 2017.The brothers traveled to Libya together in April 2017 to see family.

Simon Barraclough, the senior investigating officer for the investigation, said in a police press release Friday, authorities remain "firmly committed to establishing the truth surrounding the circumstances of the terror attack at the Manchester Arena - whether that is by supporting the ongoing public inquiry or by continuing to pursue leads with regards to the criminal investigation.""Over four years have passed since the atrocity took place but we are unwavering in our dedication to follow each line of enquiry available so that we can provide all those affected by the events at the arena with the answers they rightly deserve," Barraclough said.
