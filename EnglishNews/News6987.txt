See you never— Antonio Felix da Costa (@afelixdacosta) May 26, 2020 "Really not happy here because that was not Daniel driving the car himself, and he messed up everything. That was ridiculous," said former F1 driver Stoffel Vandoornen on his Twitch stream. "I'm questioning if it was really Daniel in the car.""Please ask Daniel Abt to put his Zoom on next time he's driving, because like Stoffel said, I'm pretty sure he wasn't in," two-time FE champion Jean-Eric Vergne said.Following an investigation by Formula E on Sunday, which included IP address verification, it was concluded that Abt could not have been behind the wheel.The gamer who replaced Abt is widely reported to be 18-year-old Lorenz Hoerzing, who competes in the FE Challenge series, a parallel championship for esport drivers. CNN has reached out to Hoerzing via his Allied esports team for comment but had not received a response at the time of publication.After all this a game that should be taken seriously, but it's a GAME. Then what about all the drivers crashing on purpose, that would probably get their licence removed if that was reality? Been out of almost all races for unsportsman behaviours and drivers using me as brakes..— Jean-Eric Vergne (@JeanEricVergne) May 26, 2020 Abt released an apology shortly afterwards in which he accepted his disqualification"I would like to apologize to Formula E, all of the fans, my team and my fellow drivers for having called in outside help during the race on Saturday," said Abt, who has promised to provide a further update on the story later on Tuesday.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videos"I did not take it as seriously as I should have.
