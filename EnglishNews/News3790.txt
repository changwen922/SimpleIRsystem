Kato got Alex when he was just one month old and he's been supporting Kato after she lost her restaurant due to the coronavirus pandemic."Tonight's attendance [is] 4,580, not including the rabbit," official scorer David Feldman announced in the seventh inning. Alex clearly has a taste for the sporty life. He's already been to a NASCAR event at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, hit the water with kayaking and often visits the beach.
