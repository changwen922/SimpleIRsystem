Messi has yet to publicly respond to El Mundo's story and didn't immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.Meanwhile, Messi scored his 650th goal for Barcelona on Sunday in a 2-1 win against Athletic Bilbao. His first-half free-kick and Antoine Griezmann's second-half winner saw Barcelona, now unbeaten in La Liga since December 5, move second in La Liga ahead of rival Real Madrid. There has been much uncertainty about Messi's future at Barcelona after he admitted last year that he had wanted to leave the club. He has also taken aim at the club's hierarchy, notably after former teammate Luis Suarez signed for Atletico Madrid in September. CNN's Patrick Sung Cuadrado contributed to reporting
