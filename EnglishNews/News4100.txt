The TTIP said Thursday it was concerned police were using people in the community as "scapegoats" for her shooting, claiming recent arrests were made with "no valid evidence." "Arresting these individuals on this basis and highlighting that they were carrying drugs with intent to supply, is subliminally suggesting that this is a gang-related crime as opposed to an attempt of murder," it said.The TTIP concluded that although they "want to see the attackers brought to justice, we do not want potentially innocent people charged with attempted murder and becoming part of the statistics, subjects to the injustices that Sasha has been fighting against."
