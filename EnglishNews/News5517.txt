Twenty people will be chosen for a video meet with Mayweather and Paul. And five people will receive a signed boxing glove by both boxers."This whole thing is surreal. Everything about it. I told my manager and we kind of had an inside joke that until I get in the ring with him, I didn't think this fight was happening," Paul said in a press release. "But I think it's safe to say that I can believe it now. I think it's happening. It's fight week. I can't imagine Floyd would back out now, but who knows? Old man fakes an injury. Gets scared of the big kid. I'm excited."Floyd Mayweather says he is 'coming out of retirement in 2020' after UFC talksRead MoreThe event includes an undercard featuring Badou Jack against Dervin Colina, "Swift" Jarrett Hurd against Luis Arias, and Chad Johnson against Brian Maxwell, Mayweather Promotions said in a press release.Paul has fought before.
