Then last week, the governor of Osaka took the relay off public roads amid a surge in Covid-19 cases as the region declared a state of emergency. There are concerns about the fate of the Olympics amid a looming fourth wave of infections in Japan -- especially given that the country has so far only vaccinated about 1.1 million people, which equates to less than one percent of its population.
