"However, where it is close enough to be clearly offensive, then the referee can take action. This is not a new 'rule' but simply an interpretation of Law 12."The guidelines add that referees "should not be looking to punish 'routine' coughing." A yellow card could also be issued if the incident is not deemed serious enough to warrant a sending-off.Players and referees are both also encouraged to avoid spitting and shouting, and it advised that physical contact as part of goal celebrations should be avoided. The FA's guidelines were introduced as the country continues to ease out of lockdown, although some localized lockdowns have been implemented in England amid fears of a second wave of infection.
