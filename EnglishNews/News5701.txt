 (CNN)Borussia Dortmund star Jude Bellingham has been fined $45,000 (40,000 euros) for comments he made about referee Felix Zwayer following his side's 3-2 defeat against Bayern Munich on Saturday.Talking about Zwayer's decision to award a penalty to Bayern for a handball against Mats Hummels, Bellingham told Viaplay Fotball: "You can look at a lot of decisions in the game. You give a referee, that has match fixed before, the biggest game in Germany -- what do you expect?"Zwayer was embroiled in a match-fixing scandal in Germany in 2005 and, at the time, said that he had never deliberately influenced the result of a match. According to Reuters, the DFB, the governing body for football in Germany, banned Zwayer for six months for his involvement in the scandal.
