As an organization, we remain strongly committed to address issues of social injustice and anti-racism and to make meaningful change for African Americans and all marginalized members of our community."READ: Curry scores career-high 62 points in Golden State Warriors victoryJUST WATCHEDAriel Atkins: 'We're really fighting for hope'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAriel Atkins: 'We're really fighting for hope' 03:54'It's disheartening'Wesley Matthews, who now plays for the Lakers, was part of the Bucks team which refused to play last year and he echoed James' thoughts on the latest announcement."Truly, it's disheartening [...] it's just about right and wrong," he told reporters after the game on Tuesday."It can't deter those citizens who are trying to do right, who are trying to fight for equality, who are trying to fight for the right things."It can't deter us, we can't lose our heads, we can't start rioting, we have to be calculated, we have to continue to keep our foot on the pedal, we have to continue to keep our foot on the gas."
