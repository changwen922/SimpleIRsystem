 (CNN)Ashleigh Barty cruised through to the semifinals at Wimbledon on Tuesday after a dominant performance against fellow Australian, Ajla Tomljanovic. The world's No. 1 wasted little energy in a brilliant display, winning 6-1 6-3 on Center Court. Her opponent, meanwhile, was playing in the first grand slam quarterfinal of her career and only managed to settle into the match during the closing stages. Barty took the opening set with ease in just over 20 minutes and broke serve early in the second set. With the match seemingly racing to its conclusion, Tomljanovic broke Barty's serve to give herself a moment's hope but her compatriot shut the door quickly, breaking back straight away and serving out the win.

"I've played with her a lot, I've practiced with her, all Aussies back home are proud of her and it was ( ... ) nice to share the court with her today."This is a dream come true. I know you hear that a lot but this is my dream and I'm extremely grateful to have an opportunity to live out what I love to do and this afternoon was no different."READ: Raducanu vows to 'come back stronger' after dream run at Wimbledon endsAshleigh Barty breezed into the Wimbledon semifinals on Tuesday.
