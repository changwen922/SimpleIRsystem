 (CNN)Seven medical professionals in Argentina have been charged with homicide over the death of soccer legend Diego Maradona.The Argentine great died from heart failure in November 2020, the same month he underwent successful surgery for a subdural hematoma, more commonly known as a blood clot on the brain.A damning investigation into his death was passed onto prosecutors earlier this month who have now requested that those accused are not permitted to leave the country. Following the investigation, prosecutors say that Maradona's medical team "violated the duties that each one was in charge of," which subsequently "led to the fatal outcome of the patient that, otherwise, could have been avoided," according to court documents. Neurosurgeon Leopoldo Luque and psychiatrist Agustina Cosachov are among those charged after being criticized previously by medical investigators.

They also looked into a lack of treatment for his heart condition, among other things.The board said it is possible to infer "that the medical team viewed fully and completely the possible death of the patient, were completely indifferent to the possibility and didn't change their behavior or treatment plan, sustaining the damaging omissions laid out previously, leaving the health of the patient 'to chance.'"
