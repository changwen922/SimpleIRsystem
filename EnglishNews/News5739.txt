"I had that feeling that I had a lot of confidence that I will be number two, and I was just trying to help him, that he finished number three. And then we did it.

The unforgettable moment in Tokyo  As the Olympics drew to a close 500 miles north of host city Tokyo, Nageeye had the race of his life on the streets of Sapporo.He executed a near-perfect race, and although his attempt to chase down eventual gold medalist and legendary marathoner Eliud Kipchoge failed, Nageeye's efforts were still brilliantly rewarded.With less than a kilometer of the race to go, a three-way battle took place between Kipchoge's Kenyan teammate Lawrence Cherono, Nageyee and Abdi for the final two medal spots.Suddenly, Nageeye appeared to slow down and visibly wave on his Belgian friend. The encouragement seemed to flip a switch as Abdi found a new stride and began to overtake Cherono for the bronze."I still remember that day. I knew it was a tough day, and a long sprint will kill him," Nageeye said of his training partner."If it's 200 meters and we start sprinting to the finish, it will hurt him because he had a lot of cramps and he was really tired. I was just trying to keep that sprint as short as possible."Nageeye and Abdi talk at the end of the men's Olympic marathon in Sapporo. The power of sportsmanshipThe Netherlands' second-ever medal in the Olympic marathon, the outcome in Tokyo ranks Nageeye among the best runners in the world.But the final moments of the event will cement his name in history. The decision to encourage his competitor was instinctive, Nageeye says."What I experienced in the past, there was always people who were helping me," Nageeye explained."I think it is now in my nature that I try to help others."Nageeye poses with his silver medal. The next generation Beyond his athletic pursuits, Nageeye continues to encourage the Somali youth through his foundation.The 32-year-old says he hopes the Abdi Nageeye Foundation can provide the younger generation with an opportunity to play sports in a safe environment outdoors."I grew up in the Netherlands, and you are able to do whatever you like as a child. At this moment, that's not possible in Somalia."Nageeye also believes sports facilities are an important contribution his foundation can offer young athletes."You can tell them to run, but you should have a place to run, a place to play, or what can they do? I really hope to help them."
