Why murdered Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia is back in the news Caruana Galizia, 53, was a leading anti-corruption journalist from Malta who was killed in a car bombing near her home in 2017. Her family say she was "assassinated" because of her work uncovering alleged corruption in the Maltese government. "A person who has admitted his involvement in the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia has denied herher right to life and has denied her her right to enjoy her family, including her grandchildren who were born after she was killed," said the lawyer representing Caruana Galizia's family in court, according to a statement released by the Daphne Caruana Galizia Foundation. "The family expresses the hope that this step will begin to lead to full justice for Daphne Caruana Galizia." In 2016, Caruana Galizia broke a story about a string of secret Panama-based companies tied to Maltese politicians on her blog, including allegations of corruption against the wife of Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat (no relation to Vincent Muscat). The couple have denied the allegations.Barbie Latza Nadeau contributed to this report.
