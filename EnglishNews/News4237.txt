 (CNN)Argentinian fencer Maria Belen Perez Maurice may have lost the chance of a medal at the Tokyo Olympics on Monday, but she is definitely still winning at life. The 36-year-old will leave the Games with a ring, after accepting a surprise marriage proposal from her coach and partner. Perez Maurice was in the middle of her post-match interview, following her 15-12 loss to Hungary's Anna Marton in the women's saber individual, when Lucas Guillermo Saucedo popped the question with a large handwritten note that said "Do you want to marry me?" in Spanish.

Saucedo revealed he had previously asked for Perez Maurice's hand in marriage in Paris after the 2010 World Fencing Championships, but she declined, saying at the time: "I am young." He said: "I love her, and when she lost the match (to Marton) she got very sad, so maybe this proposal should change her mentality. I wrote on the paper in the moment. If she had won, no, I would have waited for the moment."
