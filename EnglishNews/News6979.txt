 (CNN)Welterweight champion Kamaru Usman defeated Colby Covington by unanimous decision early Sunday at UFC 268 at New York's Madison Square Garden. Considered one of the best pound-for-pound fighters in mixed martial arts, Usman's strong takedown defense staved off Covington's challenges in the early rounds. A bloodied Covington rallied in the third, and an eye poke in the fifth from Usman temporarily paused the fight as medical staff tended to Covington. The fight was a rematch from two years ago at UFC 245, where Usman defeated Covington via a fifth-round technical knockout (TKO) in his first title defense.
