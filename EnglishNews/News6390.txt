 (CNN)The Las Vegas Raiders have waived cornerback Damon Arnette after a video emerged on social media which appeared to show Arnette holding up several guns and threatening to kill someone. The 25-year-old Arnette, who has been on injured reserve since week 4 of the NFL season, was a Raiders' first-round pick out of Ohio State in 2020. He leaves the team having played 13 games over two seasons."Today, we waived Damon Arnette -- a very painful decision," Raiders General Manager Mike Mayock said on a conference call on Monday. "We spent significant time, effort and resources trying to help him in all facets of his life. There have been a series of bad decisions over the last year or so, but we can't stand -- we cannot stand -- for the video of Damon with a gun, threatening to take a life."The decision to waive Arnette means the Raiders no longer have their top two picks from 2020 after wide receiver Henry Ruggs III was released last week.Read MoreJUST WATCHEDRaiders release Henry Ruggs III after DUI chargeReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRaiders release Henry Ruggs III after DUI charge 00:48Ruggs was charged with driving under the influence resulting in a death after his car rear-ended another vehicle and left one person dead, according to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.
