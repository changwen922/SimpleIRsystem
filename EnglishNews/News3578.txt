 (Reuters)With his inauspicious Argentina debut nothing but a distant memory, Lionel Messi became his country's most capped player on Monday in their 4-1 Copa América victory over Bolivia.A perennial candidate in the 'Greatest of All Time' debate, Messi marked the occasion in style with a virtuoso performance, scoring twice and setting up another in his 148th national team appearance, surpassing Javier Mascherano's record.It was all a far cry from his debut in 2005 when he was sent off after just 43 seconds.Coming on the pitch as a second-half substitute in a friendly against Hungary in Budapest, the then 18-year-old was red carded for swinging an arm in an opponent's face.Argentina's record scorer, Messi's 74th and 75th international goals helped extend the side's unbeaten run to 17 games on Monday and booked a quarterfinal tie against Ecuador on Saturday.Read MoreMessi is also Argentina's record scorer.Argentina have not won a major title since lifting the Copa América in 1993 and Messi, who has won every honor available to him at Barcelona, is desperate for some success in a blue and white shirt."I've been lucky enough to win everything at club level and individual level and it would be lovely also to win something with the national side," the 34-year-old said on the eve of this year's Copa. "That's my dream."His Spanish club were among those to send their congratulations for his record-breaking achievement on Monday: "A true legend, Leo!
