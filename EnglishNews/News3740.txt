A version of this story appeared in the November 5 edition of CNN's Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on Britain's royal family. Sign up here.     London (CNN)It was the ultimate compliment for Prince Charles. US President Joe Biden carved out time in his jam-packed schedule at the COP26 climate summit to meet one-on-one with the royal and tell him: "We need you badly ... and I'm not just saying that." Biden said Charles got "the whole thing going" and "that's how it all started."There's no doubt that Charles is a pioneer on green issues, delivering his first speech on the topic way back in 1970 when he warned about plastic waste. Over recent years, his focus has been on climate change and his warnings have become ever more stark. In his opening speech at COP26, Charles said climate change posed an "existential threat, to the extent that we have to put ourselves on what might be called a war-like footing."Prince Charles speaks at the UN Climate Change Conference COP26 on November 1 in Glasgow, Scotland.The prince's profile at the event was elevated because he had to step up and represent the Queen, who was unable to attend, but he has been set on making a splash at the climate talks for some time.He always planned to stay all week, to meet as many influential people as possible and persuade them to do more. It's noticeable how Charles, and indeed his son William, have put themselves at the front of the campaign to save our planet.Read MoreHistorically, royals attended summits like COP as Britain's strongest diplomatic assets, wining and dining guests. These days, they collaborate with them on projects, too.The Prince of Wales greets CEOs of global companies awarded the Terra Carta Seal on November 3.We spent a few hours with the Prince of Wales on a visit to the Kelvingrove Art Gallery in Glasgow on Wednesday. We watched as he was welcomed outside by the chief executive of McLaren Racing and their first female driver, Emma Gilmour, and was shown a model of their new Extreme E vehicle -- a rally car without the petrol. (Charles -- who you'll remember converted the engine of his own Aston Martin to run on surplus wine and whey, a by-product of cheese production -- will have no doubt loved it.)He then went inside, to a room crammed full of some of the world's most powerful business leaders, including the chief executives of AstraZeneca, Bank of America and Unilever. He presented them with the Terra Carta award, the prince's own royal seal of approval for sustainable business.Before he left, he made time for fashion designer Stella McCartney and her friend Leonardo DiCaprio for a discussion about sustainable fashion.

The pair may have expressed differing views on the merits of space tourism but they clearly haven't let it get personal.Bezos later tweeted his pride at being a founding funder of Earthshot before reflecting on William's green mission, writing: "It's easy to see how passionate and thoughtful he is about this important work."Prince William addresses leaders at the "Accelerating Clean Technology Innovation and Deployment" session on day three of COP26.But William's greatest moment at the summit perhaps came not from his high-profile meetings but in the reflected glory of a 15-year-old inventor. Teen innovator Vinisha Umashankar made the Earthshot finals for her design of a solar-powered ironing board to cut down coal usage in India. William shared the stage with her as she gave a speech that went down so well it earned her a standing ovation from world leaders, including her own Prime Minister, Narendra Modi. Earthshot Prize finalist Vinisha Umashankar"Today I ask, with all due respect, that we stop talking and start doing," she implored of the gathered VIPs. "We, the Earthshot Prize winners and finalists, need you to back our innovations, projects and solutions, not an economy built on fossil fuels, smoke and pollution. We need to stop thinking about old debates because we need a new vision for a new future. So, you need to invest your time, money and effort in us to shape our future."It's easy to imagine William or Charles using similar language and expressions, which shows how close they have come to campaigning.

The 95-year-old monarch had been lying low at the royal property following medical advice to rest for a fortnight. Her mini-break had been in the diary for some time, with doctors giving her the all clear to head to Sandringham by helicopter, according to Britain's "The Mirror" newspaper. She's understood to be traveling to her country estate to make preparations to welcome her family over Christmas, the report added. Elizabeth was seen driving around the Windsor estate on Monday, in what will have been a reassuring sight to many royal-watchers. It was the first time she'd been seen since her hospital visit last month. While she has had to forgo COP26, Buckingham Palace was clear that she intends to lead the nation when it honors its war dead, with her presence at the National Service of Remembrance on November 14. And another positive signal came from British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who on Saturday described the Queen as being "on very good form" when they spoke last week.

One movie that's getting some Oscars buzz is "Spencer," from director Pablo Larrain, and starring "Twilight" alum Kristen Stewart as Princess Di. It's been described as "a fable from a true tragedy," imagining three days she spent at Sandringham in 1991 as she contemplates her split from the royal family. Premiering in US and UK theaters on Friday, reviews are starting to drop, including from CNN senior writer Brian Lowry, who says "Stewart puts her stamp on the character." Read his full review here (and don't worry -- no spoilers).In conversation with CNN Style, Claire Mathon, one of the most in-demand cinematographers right now, revealed a spontaneity to the film's shoots, as her camera engaged in an elaborate dance with Stewart. "I had never been as close to an actress with a camera," she said. "(Stewart's) interpretation played with the camera ... It's one of the subjects of the film: (Diana's) relationship between hiding and locking herself away, while at the same time being in constant view -- too seen. How she reveals herself (is) how she remains free." Check out the full interview.FROM THE ROYAL VAULTThe press interest in Diana only grew after her marriage to Prince Charles ended. Media commentators say she needed to make sure that the narrative around her life moving forward was positive, and she was known to woo the media with lunches at Kensington Palace. "She could throw you off your guard with a flutter of the eyelids. It was a tactic," says David Banks, editorial director of the "Daily Mirror" newspaper between 1992 and 1999, in the latest episode of CNN's "Diana" series.JUST WATCHEDThis is how Diana manipulated the media ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThis is how Diana manipulated the media  01:02Don't forget that the penultimate episode -- which delves into the price of freedom following her marriage -- airs this Sunday from 9 p.m. ET/PT.

"It is a source of great pride to me that the leading role my husband played in encouraging people to protect our fragile planet, lives on through the work of our eldest son Charles and his eldest son William. I could not be more proud of them."
Queen Elizabeth II recalled her late husband, Prince Philip, and his commitment to environmental issues in her COP26 message.
The Queen described welcoming world leaders to Glasgow for the climate talks as fitting, considering it was "once a heartland of the industrial revolution," in a pre-recorded video message for a reception on Monday. She spoke of hope when nations come together for a common cause and for delegates to rise above any "politics of the moment." She ended the speech by offering her best wishes. "None of us will live forever. But we are doing this not for ourselves but for our children and our children's children, and those who will follow in their footsteps."
