Madrid (CNN)Lava flowing from the Cumbre Vieja volcano on Spain's La Palma island sparked a fire at a cement factory Monday, leading to at least 2,500 residents to be ordered into lockdown to protect their health, a local official said.The main danger came from the gas and smoke spewing from the blaze in an industrial park in the lava's path, the official, Miguel Angel Morcuende, said at a news briefing. "The committee preferred to order the lockdown for the safety of the people," said Morcuende, who is the technical director of the Canary Island government's volcano crisis committee.
