And if we didn't have Russell, I probably wouldn't have been here a long time," the 70-year-old said.Carroll watches on during the game against the New Orleans Saints at Lumen Field."Because think of all the magic that he's created in the years. He's got numbers and stats, and fourth quarters, this's and that's, and all of that stuff. One of the winningest quarterbacks in the history of the NFL.
