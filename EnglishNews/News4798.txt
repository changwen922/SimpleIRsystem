It hands Hatton, 29, an early lead in the Race to Dubai rankings -- the lucrative season-long competition to determine the best player on the European Tour."It's surreal to be honest," Hatton said. "Even there, knocking the putt in on 18, it doesn't feel like I've won the tournament."Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and featuresRead MoreHatton celebrates victory at the Abu Dhabi Championship.Hatton started the day one shot back from McIlroy and one ahead of compatriot Tommy Fleetwood.
