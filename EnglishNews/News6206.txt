 (CNN)Less than 48 hours after the formation of a new European Super League, several English clubs have already withdrawn from the controversial competition.Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester United and Manchester City have confirmed in public statements that they will no longer participate, some citing feedback from fans and other stakeholders.The withdrawal announcements came amid multiple reports on Tuesday that the 12 members of the breakaway Super League were meeting to discuss the future of the competition, first reported by TalkSPORT. CNN has reached out to the Super League for comment but has not heard back.Initial plans to form the breakaway Super League laid out on Sunday would have included six English clubs -- Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur -- alongside three teams from Italy -- AC Milan, Inter Milan and Juventus -- and three from Spain -- Atl√©tico Madrid, Barcelona and Real Madrid.READ: Super League has got Boris Johnson all fired up, but path to victory looks riskyRead More"I think this project has died today ... and it is on the way to becoming a complete botch," former Real Madrid President Ramon Calderon told CNN's Richard Quest."I think it deserves it because it was a project destined to kill football. I think mainly at this time that we are living where many clubs are struggling to survive due to the economic problems from the pandemic, what football needs is unity, solidarity."English Premier League Manchester City was one of the first to announce its defection, saying earlier on Tuesday that it had begun the process of withdrawing from the exclusive competition. "Manchester City Football Club can confirm that it has formally enacted the procedures to withdraw from the group developing plans for a European Super League," said the 2019 Premier League champion.UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin welcomed Manchester City's return to "the European football family.""They have shown great intelligence in listening to the many voices -- most notably their fans -- that have spelled out the vital benefits that the current system has for the whole of European football; from the world beating Champions League final right down to a young player's first coaching session at a grassroots club," said Ceferin in a statement.Among a later wave of defections Tuesday, Arsenal apologized for its initial Super League decision. "As a result of listening to you and the wider football community over recent days we are withdrawing from the proposed Super League. We made a mistake, and we apologise for it," the club said in a statement.A Manchester United spokesperson echoed the sentiment, citing reactions from fans and the UK government as part of its decision to withdraw. "Manchester United will not be participating in the European Super League. We have listened carefully to the reaction from our fans, the UK government and other key stakeholders," the spokesperson said. "We remain committed to working with others across the football community to come up with sustainable solutions to the long-term challenges facing the game."READ: 'Hostage to fortune' -- Blowback to 'Dirty Dozen' gathers momentumMeanwhile, Manchester United Executive Vice-Chairman Ed Woodward is to leave the club at the end of 2021, according to the Premier League team.
