 (CNN)Could Cam Newton once again be the Carolina Panthers' Superman and rescue the team? The quarterback -- famed for his touchdown celebration where he mimics Clark Kent ripping off his shirt to reveal the Superman logo underneath -- re-signed with the team where he spent nine years after agreeing to terms on Thursday. Newton, a former No. 1 overall pick by the Panthers in 2011, left in 2019. He spent last season at the New England Patriots, starting 15 games before being released in training camp after Mac Jones became the chosen starter.Together again ðŸ˜€ pic.twitter.com/PXGaVTvvZXâ€” Carolina Panthers (@Panthers) November 11, 2021
