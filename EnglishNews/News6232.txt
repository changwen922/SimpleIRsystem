Seoul, South Korea (CNN)South Korean short track speed skater Shim Suk-hee, who was at the center of public sentiment for revealing physical and sexual abuse by her former coach, has been dropped from the national team over controversial text messages, putting her hopes of taking part in the Winter Olympics in jeopardy.Two-time Olympic gold medalist Shim had accused one of her national team coaches, Cho Jae-beom, in 2018 of rape and sexual assault. Cho was sentenced to 13 years in prison on September 10 according to the Suwon High Court. But the text messages Shim exchanged with another former national team coach in 2018, which South Korea's national news agency Yonhap says have been leaked to the media from evidence Cho's lawyer submitted for the trial, have been a source of controversy with months to go until the 2022 Beijing Olympics.Mocking teammatesIn text messages exchanged with an unnamed women's national team coach during the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, Seoul-based online news outlet Dispatch reported that the two mocked Shim's teammates Choi Min-jeong and Kim A-lang, whom she had competed alongside in the 3,000m relay.

Choi's management company, All That Sports, released a statement on Tuesday citing its CEO Koo Dong-hoi's concern over the "unpatriotic act" Shim could perform at next year's Olympics after she had supported a Chinese skater at the previous Games."Supporting a national teammate's Chinese opponent at a public space, at an Olympics held in our country, despite her teammate competing, cannot be understood with common sense as she's a national athlete with a Taegeuk [Korean flag] mark on her chest," Koo said. Shim said she was mentally and physically unstable at the time due to former coach Cho's abuse, which gave her concussion symptoms. "I couldn't control the anger in me, so I'm still reflecting on showing an aggressive attitude and immature side of me to others," she said, citing Cho's abuse.

The coach texted: "If you have strength, let's make Bradbury," to which Shim agreed.Steven Bradbury is an Australian speed skater renowned for winning the most unexpected gold at the 2002 Winter Olympics. He was left to cross the finish line alone as all the other competitors in the race tumbled and fell on the ice.The two talked about making a female Bradbury several times in their text messages.During the 1,000m final at the 2018 Winter Olympics, Shim and Choi tangled and collided on the ice as they raced on the outer course of the track. Choi finished 4th and Shim was disqualified, leading to speculation in light of the text messages that she may have deliberately caused the collision.Shim leads the women's 1,000m short track speed skating quarterfinal during the 2018 Winter Olympics. But Shim, in her statement, fully denied the possibility that she was race fixing."I'd like to clarify the part in the article that stated that I fell down intentionally at the Olympics, referring to Bradbury, is not true at all," Shim said, while apologizing for scarring her teammates.Choi's representatives requested that the Korea Skating Union (KSU) and the Korean Sport & Olympic Committee (KSOC) look into the case and verify the facts regarding possible intentional collision.Koo stated: "Choi Min-jeong had not only missed her promising chance to win a gold after colliding with her teammate, but she was also seriously injured ... as she hurt her knee ligaments in the collision."He added that if Shim and the coach did try and deliberately engineer a situation similar to Bradbury's, the matter should be considered a "criminal act" that harmed Choi.Separated from the national teamShim became a national icon after sharing her experience of sexual abuse.But now the country's Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism is postponing its plan to honor Shim at its National Sports Award ceremony on Friday until a final conclusion is made from the investigation by the KSU and KSOC, the ministry official confirmed to CNN.JUST WATCHEDThe legacy of the PyeongChang 2018 Winter GamesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe legacy of the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Games 03:43The KSU temporarily banned Shim from the national training center on Monday, separating her from the rest of the national team."We think it's difficult [for Shim and the national team] to stay and train together ...
