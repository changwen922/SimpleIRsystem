 (CNN)The Australian city of Brisbane is the "preferred host" for the 2032 Summer Olympics, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced Wednesday, in a move which officials said was designed to bring "stability" to the Games after the delay of the Tokyo 2020 edition. IOC President Thomas Bach announced at a news conference Wednesday that the Olympic governing body will enter a "targeted dialogue" with the Brisbane 2032 Committee and the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) over their potential to host the 2032 Games.Under a new selection process for the Games approved in 2019, a candidate city is designated as "preferred host" following the start of "targeted dialogue." The city's bid must still be approved by an IOC vote.The announcement was met with excitement in Brisbane, the capital of Queensland state and Australia's third-largest city. State Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said this was the beginning of "a new golden age for Queensland."IOC President Bach said that the decision to advance the process for the selection of the 2032 Games had been made "given the uncertainty the world is facing right now."Read More"This uncertainty is expected to continue even after the Covid-19 health crisis is over," the IOC said in a statement Wednesday.
