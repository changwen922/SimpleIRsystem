However, both replied saying "there is an ongoing review, and we won't be commenting further while that is the case."The controversy deepened markedly on Tuesday with the emergence of a video broadcast by ITV News from the time that appears to show Number 10 officials joking about a party during a rehearsal for televised press briefings.Read MoreIn the December 2020 video, Allegra Stratton, who was at the time Johnson's spokeswoman, refers to a Christmas party, at a time when the UK was under strict lockdown conditions that limited gatherings and effectively canceled Christmas.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson leaves 10 Downing Street to attend the weekly Prime Minister's Questions at the Houses of Parliament, in London, 8 December.Jack Doyle is pictured walking into Downing Street, in London, during November 2020.On Wednesday Stratton resigned from her government position in a tearful statement.Stratton, who later served as the Prime Minister's COP26 spokeswoman, said her comments had become a "distraction" in the fight against coronavirus, and offered her resignation on Wednesday afternoon. "I understand the anger and frustration that people feel," she said in a statement on camera."To all who lost loved ones, endured intolerable loneliness and struggled with your businesses -- I am sorry and this afternoon I offered my resignation to the Prime Minister."Also, on Wednesday, Johnson announced to Parliament that his cabinet secretary would conduct an investigation, which will now look into at least three separate alleged gatherings.Boris and Carrie Johnson announce birth of baby daughterThe Prime Minister apologized "unreservedly for the offense" the leaked video had caused, but said he had been "repeatedly assured that there was no party and no rules were broken." Johnson said that if rules were broken "there will be disciplinary action for all those involved." He added that he was "furious" when he saw the video.Downing Street's position, before and since the video was leaked, is this: "There was no Christmas party and coronavirus rules had been followed at all times." After speaking to multiple officials, CNN has established that social gatherings were indeed held on the two days in question -- November 27 and December 18 -- and has confirmed a Daily Mirror report that Johnson himself gave an impromptu speech at the first one. Sources also confirmed reports that secret Santa gifts were exchanged on December 18.The accusations are damaging for the government as it seeks to enforce tougher coronavirus restrictions. On Wednesday, Johnson announced England would be tightening restrictions -- to a set of rules called "Plan B" -- due to rising cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant. From Friday, face coverings will again become mandatory in most public venues, including movie theaters. And from next week people will be advised to work from home and present a "Covid Pass" proving vaccination or recent recovery to enter nightclubs and other venues with large crowds.CNN's Luke McGee contributed reporting.
