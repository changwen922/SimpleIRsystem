Williams, who was taught to play tennis from a young age by her father, Richard, previously revealed she had signed her daughter up for tennis lessons -- without telling the instructor who she was.  In a video posted to her Instagram stories in October, she said: "Don't even start with me, because I'm not giving her tennis lessons; I signed her up for some. But the lady has no idea that it's my daughter, so we'll see how that goes." She added: "I'm not a pushy mom, but I know how I like techniques, so I'm gonna make sure she's good at teaching Olympia some techniques."
