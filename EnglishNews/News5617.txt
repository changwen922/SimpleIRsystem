 (CNN)Roger Federer has become known for his cool and composed tennis but the 20-time grand slam champion wasn't happy during his French Open win against Marin Cilic.The 39-year-old was involved in a heated exchange with the chair umpire after he was handed a time violation for taking too long between points. It triggered a lengthy conversation with the umpire with Federer clearly confused by the situation. He was then seen asking Cilic questions while standing at the net. "I didn't feel like I was playing particularly slow [...] I always feel like I don't make my opponent wait very much, but clearly Marin wanted to go faster. Now, I didn't realize that," Federer said, playing down the incident. "I just feel like it was a misunderstanding on many levels. I didn't understand it and figure it out, and I guess I'm just new to the new tour." Read More"It was quite interesting to live through it.
