Then it ran out of scapegoatsMembers of the European Parliament said the Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation should be "immediately triggered to protect the EU budget," meaning that if there's a breach of the EU's laws, Hungary's budget should be affected.

The law came into effect Thursday.It bans all educational materials and programs for children which are considered to promote homosexuality, gender reassignment and the concept of sexuality deviating from the one assigned to a person at birth.The law has been condemned by many EU leaders as being homophobic. The European Parliament says the law resembles Russia's 2013 LGBT Propaganda Law, and urged the European Commission " to investigate the financing of anti-LGBTIQ campaigns in Europe in depth."Hungary 'has no place in the EU anymore,' Dutch leader says"Parliament stresses this is not an isolated incident, 'but rather constitutes another intentional and premeditated example of the gradual dismantling of fundamental rights in Hungary,' where state-sponsored LGBTIQ-phobia and disinformation campaigns have become tools for political censorship," the EP said in a statement."These human rights violations are part of a broader political agenda to break down democracy and the rule of law, including media freedom, and should be considered a systemic violation of EU values," the statement said.The legislation is one of a string of divisive policies championed by Hungarian leader Victor Orban, a hardline nationalist who has previously railed against LGBTQ people and immigrants. Orban strongly defended the new legislation on June 24."It's not about homosexuals, it's about the kids and the parents," he said.CNN's Robert Iddiols and Amy Cassidy contributed to this report.
