 (CNN)Since Saudi-led coalition airstrikes and intense fighting began in Yemen in late March, it's estimated that 600 people have been killed. Even more have been wounded, and tens of thousands of civilians have been displaced.The International Committee of the Red Cross called for an immediate 24-hour ceasefire, to allow humanitarian aid in the most needed areas."Otherwise, put starkly, many more people will die. For the wounded, their chances of survival depend on action within hours, not days," Robert Mardini, the ICRC's head of operations in the Near and Middle East, said.As fighting continues in Yemen, several organizations are trying to help provide food, water and medical supplies that are desperately needed. While groups are trying to deploy the necessary resources to Yemen, some have had to temporarily evacuate their staffs for security reasons. They have vowed to respond to those in need as soon as it is possible.
