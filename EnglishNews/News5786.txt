 (CNN)Kyrie Irving says he's "Incredibly grateful just to be back in the building" as he spoke to the media for the first time since it was announced he would rejoin the Brooklyn Nets after a mix of Covid-19 issues and injuries depleted the NBA team's roster, resulting in three postponements of their games.Unvaccinated against Covid-19, Irving had been away from the team after Nets General Manager Sean Marks announced in October he wouldn't be allowed to play or practice "until he is eligible to be a full participant."However, the seven-time All-Star guard is only eligible to play in road games due to New York City's vaccine mandate which prohibits him from playing at Barclays Center."Not gonna lie, it has been relatively tough to watch from the sideline with everything going on in the world," Irving told reporters on Wednesday. "I know everybody is feeling it [Covid-19]. "Just praying for everybody to be healthy during these times. If I get the opportunity to get on the court and play with my teammates, even if it is just on the road for away games, I am grateful for the opportunity," added Irving, who said he had been welcomed back with "open arms" by his teammates and "the whole organization."Read MoreOn Tuesday, the US reached a record-high seven-day average for new Covid-19 cases and it is still ticking up.Tuesday's number beat the previous record of 251,989 new cases, set on January 11, 2021.

"I really had to sit back and try not to become too emotionally attached to what they were deciding to do."I had to sit down and really evaluate things and see it from their perspective. I really empathized and I understood their choice to say if you are not going to be fully vaccinated, then you can't be a full participant."I wouldn't really call it a change of heart ... either you're all in or you're going to have to wait on the sidelines until things either calm down with the mandate, with some of these cases. "We just want everybody to remain safe and to remain healthy and that was the reasoning behind it and I understood that."Asked if knew the consequences of not being vaccinated, Irving said he did, but he hadn't been "prepared for them, by no stretch of the imagination.""Coming into the season, I had my thought process of being able to be a full-time teammate and just go out and have fun and provide a great brand of basketball out there," added Irving."But unfortunately, it didn't happen like that.
