 (CNN)British Prime Minister Boris Johnson says the UK government is talking with European football governing body UEFA about "sensible accommodations" over the staging of the Euro 2020 semifinals and final at London's Wembley Stadium.The semifinals are scheduled to take place on July 6 and 7, with the final on July 11.But the three games present a public health issue for Johnson after his government this week announced a four-week extension of England's pandemic restrictions to 19 July, in an effort to accelerate vaccinations and curb the spread of the Delta coronavirus variant. Asked if the UK government would really allow thousands of fans and VIPs into the UK for the Euro semifinals and the final, Johnson said "the priority obviously has to be public health.""We'll do what we have to do to keep the country safe from Covid ... and you know, we'll be talking to UEFA about what they want and see if we can make some sensible accommodations."Read MoreThe UK government was accused of mishandling the crisis in the early days of the pandemic. As the movement of people came to a virtual standstill worldwide, the UK's borders remained open to all -- a decision that some health experts said led to overwhelmed hospitals.

There is always a contingency plan but we are confident that the final week will be held in London."The UEFA statement came after multiple British media reports that the Euro 2020 final could be moved to Hungary because of issues around quarantining and Wembley's reduced seating capacity, due to the month-long delay in the lifting of all Covid-19 restrictions in the country. The Puskas Arena in Hungary hosted a 60 000-capacity crowd between the home nation and Portugal this week and would offer UEFA the opportunity to stage the semis and final in front of a much larger crowd than the 22,500 limit in place at Wembley, although that figure is expected to increase to 45,000 for the knockout rounds.
