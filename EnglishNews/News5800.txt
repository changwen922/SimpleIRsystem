City manager Pep Guardiola was left furious on the sideline when Liverpool player James Milner was not shown a second yellow card just moments before Salah scored. Milner, who had already been cautioned, appeared to trip Foden but escaped being sent off with referee Paul Tierney showing some leniency, much to the annoyance of the City bench. "It was a yellow card, it's too much clear," Guardiola told Sky Sports after the game. "But it's Anfield, like Old Trafford. In this situation, a City player would be sent off."JUST WATCHEDMido: Jurgen Klopp has done 'unbelievable' job at LiverpoolReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMido: Jurgen Klopp has done 'unbelievable' job at Liverpool 02:51Earlier in the game, Milner had seemingly tripped Foden as the English forward burst into the box but Tierney had once again waved play on.
