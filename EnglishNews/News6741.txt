"The Australian public must be made aware of the dire situation facing our unique wildlife. With 'Songs of Disappearance', we offer the sounds of species that could soon disappear forever," said Albrecht in the press release.On its website, BirdLife Australia said the title track "celebrates the incredible diversity of the Australian soundscape, and highlights what we stand to lose without taking action."Listeners will be immersed in a "chorus of iconic cockatoos, the buzzing of bowerbirds, a bizarre symphony of seabirds, and the haunting call of one of the last remaining night parrots," BirdLife Australia adds.The project aims to show that Australians will "not allow... precious avian voices to be silenced."Habitat destruction and climate change are threatening the longevity of many bird species, according to BirdLife Australia.A study by BirdLife Australia and Charles Darwin University found about one in six Australian birds are threatened with extinction, with bush fires, severe drought and heatwaves among the biggest risks.
