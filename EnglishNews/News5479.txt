 (CNN)Every team needs a good luck charm and for Loyola University Chicago's basketball team, it comes in the form of the beloved Sister Jean. The 101-year-old nun reached TV fame in 2018 after cameras showed her pre-game prayer and her cheering from the sidelines as the team went on a Cinderella run at the NCAA tournament.

Speaking to CNN's Coy Wire, the chaplain reveals how she helps motivate the players with her prayers.  "I plan them -- every one. You should see the collection I have in my room.
