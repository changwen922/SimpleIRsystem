Miyagi, Fukushima, and Shizuoka prefectures have decided that venues can be filled to 50% of capacity with a maximum of 10,000 spectators, added Hashimoto.When asked by reporters if stakeholders would have access to venues, Toshiro Muto, the CEO of Tokyo 2020 said International Olympic Committee (IOC) members and National Olympic Committee (NOC) executives would not be counted as spectators and would continue to have access to venues as they have "roles to play during the Games."

The spectator decision comes as Tokyo reported 920 new infections for Wednesday -- the highest daily caseload since the middle of May. "There is a remarkable increase of infections especially in the big cities in the Tokyo area," said Yasutoshi Nishimura, the minister in charge of the country's pandemic response. The more infectious Delta variant now accounts for up to 30% of cases, he added.The state of emergency -- the fourth in the Japanese capital since the pandemic began -- will cover the entire period of the Olympics, which are scheduled to run from July 23 to August 8.Last month, Olympic organizers said spectators would be allowed at the Games, with a cap of 10,000 people per venue or 50% of venue capacity.

I wanted to be in the Olympics because I wanted to show my best performance in front of my family and supporters, but this will not be in the form that I've been imagining," she told CNN previously.Tokyo lifted its previous round of state of emergency on June 20, at the end of the country's fourth wave of infections. It has continued to impose restrictions under a softer "quasi-emergency," such as an 8 p.m. curfew on dine-in service at restaurants. But cases have been rising again, prompting health experts to call for stricter measures.Japan has lagged behind Western countries in rolling out its vaccination drive.
