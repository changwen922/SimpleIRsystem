It's as if Dechambeau is golf's answer to Superman.

I'm living on the razor's edge like I've told people for a long time."It's quite finicky for me because it's a golf course that's pretty short, and so when I hit the driver and it doesn't go in the fairway, it's first cut or whatever, or it's in the hay, it's tough for me to get it out on to the green. Like once in the middle of the fairway like I had it on 18, I was able to hit a nice shot to 11 feet and almost made birdie."Later DeChambeau issued an apology on Instagram saying: "I sucked today, not my equipment.""I deeply regret the words I used earlier," he wrote. "I am relentless in pursuit of improvement and perfection. Part of that causes me to become outwardly frustrated at times. ... My game is a constant work in progress and so is controlling my emotions."READ: Georgia Oboh: Nigeria's first Ladies European Tour playerDeChambeau lines up a shot during day one of The Open.'Progressing nicely'While DeChambeau struggled, his playing partner Spieth had a more serene time of of it.The three-time major winner hit six birdies and just one bogey on his way to a five-under par round and just one shot off clubhouse leader Oosthuizen.After a few lean years on the PGA Tour having burst onto the scene as a youngster, Spieth looks to have rediscovered his touch over recent months, finishing third at the Masters in April and claiming his first win in 1,351 days at the Valero Texas Open just before the Augusta tournament. "To be honest, the path that I'm on and where I've been before in the game, I feel really good about my chances going forward, as good as they have been historically," Spieth told the media.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosSpieth reacts after making his birdie putt on the 15th green during his first round of The Open."As far as surprised or not, I guess I feel like I've been trending the right way and certainly had a chance this year already at Augusta. Made some mistakes in the first round and second round that I shouldn't have made that I very well could have won that golf tournament this year. I like where I'm at."Again, I feel like I was progressing nicely. Took a couple steps back really on the weekend at Colonial through the US Open, and I know what it was now and tried to put in some good work over the last few weeks to get back on the same and even forward it from where I was already progressing."
