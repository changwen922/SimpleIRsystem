The cities' vaccination policies do not apply to players from visiting teams who compete at their arenas.The Knicks have fully vaccinated all its players following the NBA's warning, CNN has learned, while the Nets and Warriors have yet to clear the threshold or gain exemptions otherwise.NBA requiring Covid-19 vaccinations for referees and others who work with playersKnicks general manager Scott Perry had a sit-down, off-camera interview with reporters Friday, the team told CNN, and said players along with coaches and staff are in compliance with New York City's required vaccination rules.In Brooklyn, some of the Nets' players are not yet eligible, but general manager Sean Marks told reporters that he's confident everyone will be allowed to participate by the start of the NBA season on October 19.

Pro athletes and leagues are sometimes at odds over vaccines, much like the rest of America Players are not required to be vaccinated against Covid-19 to play, a source with knowledge of negotiations between the league and the players' union told CNN earlier this month.No major professional sports league in the United States has required its players to be vaccinated, but a relaxing of Covid-19 safety procedures have often been granted after a threshold of vaccination is reached.The NBA announced last month that it would require referees and other personnel who work with players during the 2021-22 season to be fully vaccinated unless they have a religious or medical exemption. "The referees have also agreed to take any recommended boosters," the league said in a statement last month. "Any referee who does not get vaccinated and is not exempt will be ineligible to work games."CNN's Jill Martin and David Close contributed to this report.
