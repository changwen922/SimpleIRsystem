 (CNN)Kylian Mbappé and Lionel Messi put on a show as Paris Saint-Germain beat Club Brugge 4-1 in the Champions League on Tuesday.With the French club already through to the knockout stages, this was largely an opportunity for PSG to flex its muscles, and its stars certainly helped to do that. Before supporters could even settle in their seats to watch the final group stage match, Mbappé had put the host ahead after just 70 seconds of the match, firing home after goalkeeper Simon Mignolet parried a shot. The 22-year-old then doubled his tally with a wonderfully crafted volley in the seventh minute after Angel Di Maria had chipped a pass over the defense. Mbappé is now the youngest player in Champions League history to reach 30 goals.

The Champions League remains PSG's biggest goal and, despite not hitting the heights in every game this season and with the injury to Neymar, this match served as a reminder of the attacking capabilities of this star-studded squad. It will certainly face tougher challenges in the later rounds, but few teams will feel confident facing Messi and Mbappé in this form. Atlético Madrid progressesWhile many groups had already been decided going into the final round of group games, there was all to play for in Group B. Liverpool had already qualified top but AC Milan, Atlético Madrid and Porto could all still go through as runner-up. It was the Spanish side that secured the final qualification place after beating Porto 3-1, in a match that saw three players sent off. Diego Simeone's side, which was helped by Liverpool beating AC Milan 2-1, went ahead after Antoine Griezmann prodded home at the back post in the 56th minute before Ángel Correa and Rodrigo De Paul secured the victory with stoppage time goals. There was still time for Sergio Oliveira to score a penalty for the host but it will serve as very little consolation for the Portuguese side, which lost both Wendell and goalkeeper Agustín Marchesín, who was not on the pitch, to red cards in the second half. Atlético, which had gone into the game bottom of the group, had gone down to 10 men earlier in the second half after Yannick Carrasco was dismissed.
