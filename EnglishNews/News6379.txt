"We started the year in December ... so his preparation schedule was thrown off and he just got behind the curve.""It's pretty clear now that he's working his way back to where he needs to be. All his physical and conditioning indicators are really going in a good, strong direction. And you can tell on the floor. You can see that he's getting better and better as each day goes by."Doncic's triple-double was the 26th of his short career. It's the third time the 21-year-old has had 30-plus points, 15-plus rebounds and 10-plus assists in a game.

"We've played two good games. That's great," he told reporters. "But we haven't even scratched the surface yet. This team, I think we have good potential, a lot of young guys, a lot of young talent that we can continue to build, and they'll continue to grow and get better. But we're a long ways off."Are we ready to compete with those teams? I don't know. But we will compete, and that's the thing."
