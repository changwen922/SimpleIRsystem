 (CNN)In a campaign overshadowed by the health of Christian Eriksen, who suffered a cardiac arrest during Denmark's opening Euro 2020 game, the Danish national team delivered a pulsating performance against Russia to secure an unlikely place in the tournament's knockout stages.Having lost their opening two games, Denmark thumped Russia 4-1 in Copenhagen on Monday and with Group B winner Belgium beating Finland 2-0 in St. Petersburg, the Danes finished second, setting up a last-16 match against Wales in Amsterdam on Saturday.Ahead of Denmark's second group B game -- the 2-1 defeat by Belgium -- a giant shirt bearing Eriksen's name with the number 10 was unfurled and the popular "You Will Never Walk Alone" football anthem was played.Those tributes were repeated on Monday as the Danish fans got into voice, with Mikkel Damsgaard's thunderous strike then setting the tempo for Denmark's stirring display in an emotionally charged Parken Stadium.Denmark's Mikkel Damsgaard celebrates after scoring his side's opening goal against Russia.Yussuf Poulsen capitalized on a Russian defensive error to make it 2-0.Yussuf Poulsen pounced on Roman Zobnin's awful back pass to extend Denmark's lead, before Russian striker Artem Dzyuba's penalty made it 2-1.Read MoreDenmark regrouped and Andreas Christensen's stunning long-range shot restored the Danes' two-goal advantage with Joakim Maehle then adding a fourth.When that fourth goal went in Danish fans could have been forgiven for thinking they were part of a 21st century fairytale."I've never experienced anything like this," Maehle told Danish broadcaster DR.
