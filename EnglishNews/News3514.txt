 (CNN)Skiing star Mikaela Shiffrin equaled Ingemar Stenmark's record for the most World Cup wins in a single discipline on Sunday as she claimed the 46th slalom victory of her career. Having trailed Petra Vlhova after the first run, Shiffrin took the lead on the second and finished 0.75 seconds ahead of her rival in Killington, Vermont, moving level with the record that Stenmark has held for 32 years. "I actually didn't know (about) the record," Shiffrin told NBC Sports. "I won't say it's not meaningful. It certainly is, but I'm trying not to focus on those numbers. The closer I get to these marks, it's hard not to think about it and want that."Stenmark, the Swedish slalom specialist who competed in the 1970s and 80s, also holds the record for the most World Cup wins with 86, while Shiffrin is third on the all-time list with 71.
