The team continued as a minor player until 1977.Mosley's position with March led to an invite to meetings of the Grand Prix Constructors' Association.In 1974 he helped create the new Formula One Constructors' Association along with Bernie Ecclestone and other leading lights.Mosley continued his involvement in motor sports through the 1980s, becoming president of the FISA Manufacturer's Commission -- part of motor sport's governing body. He also founded Simtek, a firm specializing in technical advice for racing.Mosely also campaigned for tighter press regulation after the UK's News of the World newspaper published a story in 2008 alleging he was involved in a sado-masochistic orgy with five prostitutes that involved Nazi role-playing. A British court found that there was no Nazi element to the incident and ordered the tabloid to pay Mosley damages in compensation in the privacy case.
