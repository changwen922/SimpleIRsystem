Officials have started the evacuation of about 700 residents in the Ophoven neighborhood in the city of Wassenberg. Dutch officials ordered the evacuation of 10,000 people in the municipality of Venlo, where the Maas river rose faster than expected. The high waters are expected to last until Sunday evening. Officials fear more dams can break and are closely monitoring reservoirs in the region.Barring any more severe weather, people who evacuated the flooding in the county of Euskirchen in North Rhine-Westphalia can most likely return to their home sometime on Sunday, the county said on its Facebook page.  This comes as water is being drained from the Steinbach dam to reduce pressure. Officials said creeks are filling, but are not expected to overflow their banks.   Officials had been monitoring the dam by drone earlier in the day and found no significant damage.  A clogged pipe has also been opened up to help with the water release.  Germany has deployed 850 troops to assist with disaster relief, the Bundeswehr (Germany armed forces) said Friday in a tweet."Together with civilian helpers, the technical relief organization, fire brigades, we are pooling all available forces," Bundeswehr officials said.Federal Minister of Defence Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said she had spoken with her French counterpart Florence Parly who also offered military help.Germany's President Frank-Walter Steinmeier will visit the Rhein-Erft district of North Rhine-Westphalia state on Saturday, his office announced. Many without powerAt least 165,000 people are currently without power in Rhineland-Palatinate and neighboring North Rhine-Westphalia, authorities told CNN. In North Rhine-Westphalia, where at least 43 people have died, the state's Interior Ministry spokeswoman Katja Heins told CNN: ''The situation remains very dynamic -- we do not know how many people are unaccounted for." The death toll in Rhineland-Palatinate has risen to at least 62, according to police, who said on Friday that at least 362 people have been injured. The state premier, Malu Dreyer, said that every hour brought bad news. "It is to be feared that the number will rise even further, '' Dreyer said at a news conference, adding: ''We have not yet reached the stage where we can say that situation is easing." Record rainfallAs rescue efforts continued on Friday, more tragic scenes came to light. At least nine people at a disabled care facility drowned after being caught in floodwaters. The facility, located in the town of Sinzig, in the Ahrweiler district, became so quickly inundated that the residents -- who had been sleeping --  were unable to escape, despite efforts by caretakers to bring them to safety, according to CNN affiliate NTV.The states of North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland have been the worst affected by the record rainfall, which authorities have called the heaviest in a century. ''In some areas we have not seen as much rainfall in 100 years," a spokesperson for the German weather service DWD said, adding that in those regions, they have "seen more than double the amount of rainfall," causing flooding and structures to collapse. EU unveils ambitious climate package as it cools on fossil fuels Large swaths of western Germany saw 24-hour rainfall totals between 100 and 150 millimeters (3.9-5.9 inches), which represent more than a month's worth of rainfall in this region, according to CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller.Cologne, in North Rhine-Westphalia, recorded 154 millimeters (6 inches) of rainfall in the 24 hours to Thursday morning, which is nearly double its monthly average for July of 87 millimeters.Heavier localized downpours resulted in extreme flash flooding. In Reifferscheid, in the Ahrweiler district, an incredible 207 millimeters (8.1 inches) of rain fell in only nine hours, according to the European Severe Weather Database.The intense deluges were the result of a slow-moving area of low pressure, which allowed a conveyor belt of warm and moist air to fuel powerful thunderstorms and heavy, long-lasting rain, according to the German weather service.Flood damage in North Rhine Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate is severely affecting train travel, according to Germany's rail service Deutsche Bahn, which is warning people to avoid the regions over the weekend.
