"He was responsible for the massacre of men, women and children at the Srebrenica genocide and helped prosecute the siege of Sarajevo with its remorseless attacks on civilians."We should take pride in the fact that, from UK support to secure his arrest, to the prison cell he now faces, Britain has supported the 30-year pursuit of justice for these heinous crimes," he added.Karadžić, whose Interpol charges listed "flamboyant behavior" as a distinguishing characteristic, was a practicing psychiatrist who came to be nicknamed the "Butcher of Bosnia."Amanpour: The Srebrenica genocide was a defining momentAs the leader of the breakaway Serb Republic in Bosnia, Karadžić commanded troops who carried out widespread massacres of Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats during a campaign of ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s.Read MoreIn March 2016, he was found guilty of genocide and other crimes against humanity, in what was seen as one of the most important war crimes trials since World War II.
