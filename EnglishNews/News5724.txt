 (CNN)Four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel will remain in Formula One after signing a deal with the Racing Point team, which will rebrand itself as Aston Martin from next season.There had been some doubt as to whether the German would continue in F1 after Ferrari announced in May that McLaren's Carlos Sainz would be taking his seat.However, Sergio Perez announced on Wednesday that he would be leaving Racing Point at the end of the current season, despite having a deal until 2022, opening up a space on the grid."I'm extremely proud to say that I will become an Aston Martin driver in 2021," Vettel said in a statement. "It's a new adventure for me with a truly legendary car company. I have been impressed with the results the team has achieved this year and I believe the future looks even brighter."The energy and commitment of Lawrence [Stroll, Racing Point part-owner] to the sport is inspiring and I believe we can build something very special together.
