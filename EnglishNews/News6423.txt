 (CNN)Brisbane, Australia is set to host the 2032 Olympics after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) endorsed its unopposed bid for the future Games."This unanimous decision by the Executive Board is a credit to the years of work carried out by Brisbane 2032, the Australian Olympic Committee, and their partners, to test every aspect of the project," the IOC said in a statement Thursday.Speaking in Geneva, Switzerland, IOC President Thomas Bach said Brisbane's track record in hosting large sporting competitions and broad political and public support for the event made the city's bid "irresistible.""The future of the Games is bright," Bach said.
