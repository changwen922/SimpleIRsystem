 (CNN)Team New Zealand (TNZ) retained the America's Cup on Wednesday, defeating Italian outfit Luna Rossa 7-3 in the best-of-13 series. It's the fourth time a New Zealand team has lifted the "Auld Mug," international sport's oldest trophy, whilst Italy still waits for its first triumph. In front of thousands of spectators, TNZ simply dominated race 10 -- securing a 46-second win in home waters -- as it was crowned champion off the coast of Aukland. "It's unreal. Seeing all the people involved over three-four years, how many Kiwis out here supporting the campaign," said TNZ helmsman Peter Burling. "Messages from everyone, from the Prime Minister to high school kids, it means the world to us," added Burling, referring to New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern.Read More"We're blown away by what we've achieved as a group."READ: America's Cup yachts close on speeds of 100 kphTeam New Zealand was applauded by fans following its  America's Cup win.
