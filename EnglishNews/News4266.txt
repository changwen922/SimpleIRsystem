 (CNN)If you thought the idea of a European football Super League was dead and buried, then think again.On Monday, European football's governing body UEFA was forced to drop its disciplinary proceedings against the three remaining Super League clubs.Real Madrid, Juventus and Barcelona all refused to renounce the breakaway league when the project collapsed in April following widespread fan protests.UEFA subsequently attempted to ban the three clubs from competing in the Champions League, but a Spanish court ruling forced UEFA to pause the disciplinary case in June."Following the stay of proceedings against FC Barcelona, Juventus FC and Real Madrid CF, in the matter related to a potential violation of UEFA's legal framework in connection with the so called 'Super League,' the UEFA Appeals Body has declared today the proceedings null and void, as if the proceedings had never been opened," the governing body said in a statement.Read MoreThe nine clubs that did pull out of the Super League project -- Arsenal, AC Milan, Chelsea, Atl√©tico Madrid, Inter Milan, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur -- were subsequently handed financial penalties by UEFA.Collectively, the teams were to donate 15 million euros ($18.25M) to charities and to forgo 5% of the revenues they would have received from competitions. UEFA said the clubs have agreed to be fined up to 100 million euros ($121.7M) should they breach their UEFA commitments.However, the new ruling means these fines cannot be applied.READ: Nine of 12 Super League clubs recommit to UEFA and admit project was a mistakeJUST WATCHEDLiverpool's owner apologizes for European Super League planReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHLiverpool's owner apologizes for European Super League plan 01:56New legal battleIn its ongoing legal battle with the Super League rebel clubs, UEFA said in a statement on Tuesday that it "does not recognise the jurisdiction of the Court in Madrid" and will be making an appeal to a higher court in Madrid.UEFA added it had made formal submissions to the Court in Madrid "evidencing its ongoing compliance with the orders.""In addition, UEFA has filed a motion for the recusal of the judge presiding over the current proceedings as it believes there are significant irregularities in these proceedings," UEFA said.

Players are now allowed to move on free transfers when their deals with clubs expire.
