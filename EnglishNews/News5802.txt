Wembley Stadium, London (CNN)England gave Germany a lesson in ruthless finishing, converting its only two real chances of this Euro 2020 last-16 match to finally end its decades-long inferiority complex against its old, historic rival.Germany hadn't lost a knockout match to England in a major international competition since the 1966 World Cup final, but second half goals from Raheem Sterling and Harry Kane secured the home side a 2-0 win and passage through to the quarterfinals.For the neutral, it certainly wasn't a thriller. At times, both sides seemed more scared at the prospect of losing than excited at the thought of winning.Chances were few and far between; indeed, Germany had the better opportunities until England stole the lead in the 75th minute thanks to Sterling's close-range finish. Playing in front of a partizan 40,000 crowd that made Wembley Stadium feel like it was at capacity, England capitalized on their chances when it mattered.Read MoreEngland head coach Gareth Southgate's introduction of Jack Grealish in the second half also helped change the course of the match.

First Sterling brought out a wonderful save from Manuel Neuer, before Harry Maguire's header from the subsequent corner was comfortably gathered by the German goalkeeper.As things became more frantic and the decibels increased, Southgate appeared the calmest man inside Wembley Stadium, hands in pockets as he strolled around his technical area, occasionally extending his hand to offer some tactical advice to his players.England certainly had the upper hand now, but without troubling Germany too much. Maguire rose high at the far post after some nice link up play between Kalvin Phillips and Kieran Trippier, but his effort soared high over the bar when he perhaps should have done better. Germany gradually began playing its way back into the game and had arguably the game's best chance when Timo Wener was played through on goal. The angle may have been right, but his effort was still well saved by Pickford.The away side was now beginning to enjoy the upper hand and the home fans' frustration boiled over in a chorus of jeers when Trippier had the opportunity to put the ball into the box, but instead opted for a short pass.England captain and prolific striker Kane has come in for some criticism during Euro 2020, failing to get onto the score sheet -- or even get into the game -- in all three of England's group games, and he touched the ball just twice in the opening 30 minutes here.England captain Harry Kane celebrates after scoring his side's second goal.Exorcised demonsGermany continued to improve at the start of the second period and almost caught England cold inside the opening five minutes. It took a wonderful save from Pickford to deny Kai Havertz's long- range strike, which looked for a split second like it would sneak under the crossbar.However, a jinking run from Sterling, twisting this way and that between the German defense, got the crowd back on its feet. The Manchester City forward looked to have fashioned an opening, but the wall of black shirts quickly closed to block off any opportunity.Both managers made their first change with just over 20 minutes left to play, with Grealish coming on to an enormous roar as he replaced Bukayo Saka and Joachim LÃ¶w opting to bring off Werner for Serge Gnabry.A Germany fan reacts during the UEFA Euro 2020 Championship Round of 16 match between England and Germany at Wembley Stadium.Then, all of a sudden, England's fans got the breakthrough they had hoped for.Shaw found just a little pocket of space on the left side of Germany's box and was picked out by Grealish, before firing a delicious low cross straight across goal that Sterling was on hand to tap in under Neuer.Cue pandemonium inside Wembley, as the crowd finally started to believe their tournament hoodoo against Germany was coming to end.That feeling grew when Thomas Mueller was clean through on goal after Sterling had given the ball away cheaply, but the Bayern Munich forward dragged his shot wide.Germany's Thomas Mueller reacts after a missed chance during the UEFA Euro 2020 Championship Round of 16 match between England and Germany.At the other end of the pitch, Sterling sunk to his knees in relief and pounded the Wembley turf.When Kane converted the second, nodding home Grealish's cross less than five minutes after Mueller's miss, this home crowd knew their team was through to the quarterfinals.The noise inside Wembley was deafening -- these supporters haven't had an occasion like this to cheer for a quarter of a century. They will be hoping to go two steps further than 1996 but, for now, they were just going to enjoy only their second ever knockout win at a European Championship.
