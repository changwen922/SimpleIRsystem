This was the biggest challenge," said Hioki.Due to restrictions, only a select number of officials and some dignitaries will be present for the Friday's ceremony.Tokyo 2020 Opening Ceremony: Number of participants per countrySOUTH KOREA 26 athletes at Opening Ceremony Flag bearers: Hwang Sun-woo and Kim Yeon-koug Total members of team: 354 (232 of which are athletes) CANADAApprox 30 to 40 athletes at Opening CeremonyFlag Bearers: Miranda Ayim and Nathan HirayamaTotal members of team: 370 INDIA50 members at Opening Ceremony (athletes and officials)Total members of India Team at the Games: 228 (119 of which are athletes)AUSTRALIAApproximately 50 members at Opening Ceremony (athletes and officials)Total members team: 472 athletes (total members unavailable)Tokyo 2020 spokesman Hidemasa Nakamura told CNN that about 950 VIPs will take part in the event.

They can finally be there and can enjoy this moment under very special circumstances. And a feeling of relief because the road to this Opening Ceremony was not the easiest one."However as Covid-19 cases continue to rise in Tokyo, there will be notable absentees on Friday. Japanese car manufacture Toyota has confirmed its CEO, Akio Toyoda, will not be attending the opening ceremony."The motto of the Tokyo 2020 Games is "United by Emotion," added Hioki."We spent a lot of time and energy struggling and what we came up with was 'achieving personal best,' 'unity in diversity,' 'connecting to tomorrow'; in other words, the Games vision."We have created something with a strong message that will resonate with the audience. It's more about the emotional connection than the excitement."We took the athletes very seriously. We had to make sure the athletes who finally have come from abroad don't feel anxious, and yet we want them to be energised and ready for competition."Marco Balich, a former opening ceremonies executive producer and now a senior advisor to the Tokyo ceremony, told Reuters that Friday's event will be a "sobering" ceremony."Nevertheless with beautiful Japanese aesthetics.
