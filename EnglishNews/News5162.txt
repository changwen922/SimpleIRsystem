I don't know about you, but when we conceded that goal early on and then equalized, and then ran on right the way into extra-time. "It could have gone wrong at any stage, but it didn't and it was just euphoric. Absolutely extraordinary. So I congratulate Gareth Southgate and the whole team. I thought they were stunning and obviously, you know, wishing them all the very best for the Sunday."Later on Thursday, UEFA Referees Committee announced that Dutchman Bj√∂rn Kuipers would referee Sunday's final.This will be Kuipers' seventh UEFA competition final, according to European football's governing body.
