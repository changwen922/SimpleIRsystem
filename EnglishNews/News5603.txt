However, with less than six weeks to go, there was not even a roof on the main building.A special detachment of military builders toiled with masonry, slapping on cement and laying bricks, a Ukrainian flag billowing as they worked.The scale of the task at hand became even starker as we walked down onto the port, joined to a commercial port.Construction of a housing facility at the Berdyansk port has been underway since September.

CNN learned Tuesday that part of the deal will focus on Berdyansk.The same day, the Ukrainian navy announced the arrival of two "Island-type" boats named "Fastiv" and "Sumy," delivered from Baltimore in the United States to Odessa in Ukraine."Soon the boats will raise the Ukrainian navy flag and under the command of Ukrainian crews they will begin their combat journey to ensure maritime safety in the Black and Azov seas," Admiral Alexey Neizhpapa said.The bigger question is whether new Ukrainian ships and infrastructure, plus warnings from the West, will be enough of a deterrent.
