Bruzgi, Belarus (CNN)Russia and Belarus flexed their military might for a third time this week near the Poland-Belarus border, where thousands of people are stranded in deplorable conditions, trapped at the center of an intensifying humanitarian and geopolitical crisis. On Friday, Russia and Belarus held joint paratrooper drills near Poland, exercises the Belarusian defense ministry said were "in connection with the buildup of military activity near the state border of the Republic of Belarus." Two Russian paratroopers died during the maneuvers after their parachutes failed due to strong wind, state news agency TASS reported, citing Russia's defense ministry.Some 15,000 Polish soldiers have been deployed to Poland's border with Belarus in recent days in reaction to a tense standoff that the European Union, the United States and NATO say is of Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko's making. NATO said Friday it was monitoring for any escalation or provocation in the situation on its members' borders with Belarus after the drills.Western leaders, including prime ministers of neighboring Poland, Latvia and Lithuania, are accusing the Lukashenko regime of manufacturing a migrant crisis on the EU's eastern frontier as retribution for sanctions over human rights abuses.Tensions are rising on the Poland-Belarus border.

Russia demonstrated that support by flying two long-range Russian Tupolev Tu-22M3 supersonic long-range bombers over Belarusian airspace on Wednesday and on Thursday.The aircraft, known to have nuclear capabilities, practiced "issues of interaction with ground control points" with armed forces of both countries, the Russian defense ministry said.

On Thursday, it announced it would hold military drills with some 8,500 servicemen and 15 helicopters in an area near its borders with Poland and Belarus to counter a potential migrant crisis.The show of force unfolding across the region is continuing to test a fragile political order, with allegations from the United States on Russia's military buildup this week deepening concerns over the potential for a wider geopolitical crisis.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday that the US is "concerned by reports of unusual Russian military activity" and mentioned the possibility that Russia may be "attempting to rehash" its 2014 invasion of Ukraine.Russia hit back at the allegations on Friday, saying that they represented an "empty, groundless escalation of tensions."Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) and Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko shake hands in Sochi, Russia, earlier this year.'This will not succeed'European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called the border crisis a "challenge to the whole of the European Union" earlier this week.

This will not succeed," she said.Western powers are now preparing to levy new sanctions on Belarus, and the EU said it was considering penalties against third-country airlines for contributing to the crisis by transporting people to Minsk, the Belarusian capital. On Friday, Turkey's foreign ministry said in a tweet that they would ban people from Syria, Iraq and Yemen -- where many of the migrants stuck at the border are from -- from flying from Turkish airports to Belarus. The ministry on Thursday fought back against claims it was contributing to the crisis, saying that they "refuse to be portrayed as part of a problem which Turkey is not a party to." EU Council President Charles Michel replied to the tweet, saying "thank you" for the "support and cooperation." Moscow hasn't budged however, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissing accusations that the Russian carrier Aeroflot had helped refugees travel into Belarus. Statements from Aeroflot demonstrate that it "did not provide and is not providing transportation of migrants to Minsk," Peskov said, adding that "even if some airlines are engaged in this, it in no way contradicts any international regulations."In the US, the White House's National Security Council announced on Wednesday that it was preparing "follow-up sanctions" designed to hold Belarus accountable for "ongoing attacks on democracy, human rights and international norms." This is the second round of sanctions announced by the US in recent months. It is not clear when the new measures will be executed.The EU is also expected to "expand and tighten its sanctions against Lukashenko's regime," Germany's acting Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Thursday.The human costMigrants gather to receive humanitarian aid in a camp on the Belarusian-Polish border in Belarus' Grodno region on November 12, 2021.
