 (CNN)Teenager Su Yiming is used to fast-paced action, but he's really taken things up a notch at the Beijing Winter Olympics. The 17-year-old Su is a former child actor, appearing in the 2014 action movie "The Taking of Tiger Mountain" when he was eight, alongside superstars including Tony Leung, before deciding to drop acting for snowboarding.And his time at the Winter Games has read more like a movie script, with twists and turns galore. Last week, the Chinese snowboarder narrowly missed out on a gold medal in the slopestyle event to Canada's Max Parrot, eventually claiming silver. However, unbeknownst to the judging panel at the time, the Canadian had grabbed his knee instead of his board during a trick -- a mistake which would have resulted in a points deduction.

Despite the controversy, Sumatic said that he received a call after the event from Su and his coach, saying that they were happy with the result," and that they "totally respect" the decision made.Despite missing out by gold in such circumstances, but Su showed no signs of being effected, bouncing back to win his own gold in the big air event on Tuesday. "I had many dreams when I was a child," Su said. "To be an Olympic champion was one of them, and today, I already realized my dream."There will be more and more challenges in the future. I will be more concentrated on my goals. All I need to do is to deliver all my efforts to achieve my goals."Su performs a trick during the men's snowboard big air final,New starsAlongside Eileen Gu, Su is one of a new breed of Chinese Olympic sensations.

I feel a special joy from snowboarding that I cannot feel from anything else. I will try harder to let more people know about and love this sport."Su picked up snowboarding when he was just four years old, balancing it with acting until he chose to solely focus on the winter sport.
