"There are situations outside football that you have to take into account," he said. "I think the players are the first to be aware of it, as we are, of the disappointment of having lost three points, but there are things that you already know, that the group is concerned about."They are concerned not only about the defeat, but about things that you probably already know about."It's not an excuse, but there was an unusual drop in energy."So, when your colleague asked me if we had spoken with the players, yes, we had spoken with the players, but not about what happened football-wise. We'll have time to talk about that tomorrow (Monday)."PSG had led at halftime through Julian Draxler's goal, but scores from Randal Kolo Muani and Moses Simon in the second period handed Nantes an unlikely victory over the French champion.
