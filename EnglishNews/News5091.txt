It is unclear if James had tested positive for Covid-19 or whether he had come into close contact with someone who had. Lakers head coach Frank Vogel said the team arranged for transportation to get James back to Los Angeles safely. "Obviously, it's a huge loss," Vogel said Tuesday ahead of the game in Sacramento. "It's disappointing. We just want the best for him right now."In September, James said he received the vaccine despite being skeptical at first.
