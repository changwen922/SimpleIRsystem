 (CNN)Legendary Indian sprinter Milkha Singh has died at the age of 91 after a month-long battle with Covid-19, according to a family statement obtained by CNN affiliate News 18. Known as the "Flying Sikh," Singh was one of India's most successful track and field athletes. He won four Asian Games gold medals and became India's first Commonwealth Games champion in 1958. The following year, Singh was honored with the Padma Shri, one of India's highest civilian honors.  Singh contracted Covid-19 last month and was being treated at a hospital in India's northern city of Chandigarh. He died late Friday after developing complications including fever and dropping oxygen saturation levels, according to News 18."He fought hard but God has his ways and it was perhaps true love and companionship that both our mother Nirmal ji and now Dad have passed away in a matter of 5 days," the family statement said. Singh's wife Nirmal Kaur, a former national volleyball captain, also died of the virus last Sunday.Read MoreTributes to Singh flooded social media on Saturday, with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying he was "anguished" by the news.In the passing away of Shri Milkha Singh Ji, we have lost a colossal sportsperson, who captured the nation's imagination and had a special place in the hearts of countless Indians.
