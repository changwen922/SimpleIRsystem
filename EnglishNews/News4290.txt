"It's just a moment of time, opportunity, and I'm glad that I was able to get this opportunity now and that I was able to showcase what I can do in front of these players.

It's my first quarterfinals in a grand slam. I'm just going to enjoy it at 100% and tomorrow is going to be a new day."Alcaraz and Fernandez could yet be joined in the quarterfinals by another teenager, with 18-year-old Briton Emma Raducanu set to face Shelby Rogers in the last 16 on Monday.Raducanu burst onto the scene at Wimbledon earlier this year where she reached the fourth round and will now be aiming to go one better at Flushing Meadows.
