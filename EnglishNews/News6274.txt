 (CNN)In an exclusive interview with Golf Digest, Tiger Woods spoke publicly about his golfing future for the first time since his car crash earlier this year. "I think something that is realistic is playing the tour one day, never full time, ever again, but pick and choose, just like Mr. (Ben) Hogan did," Woods told interviewer Henni Koyack."Pick and choose a few events a year and you play around that. You practice around that, and you gear yourself up for that. And you play. I think that's how I'm going to have to play it from now on."It's an unfortunate reality, but it's my reality. And I understand it, and I accept it."Tiger Woods posts first video taking practice swings since car accident in FebruaryWoods began the remote interview from his South Florida home by walking into the room with what he called a slight "hitch" in his stride, evidence of the serious leg injuries suffered in a car crash near Los Angeles in February.Read MoreWoods says during his grueling rehabilitation, things as simple as watching his son play or listening to birds sing have taken on greater meaning."I have so far to go ... I'm not even at the halfway point. I have so much more muscle development and nerve development that I have to do in my leg. At the same time, as you know, I've had five back operations. So I'm having to deal with that. So as the leg gets stronger, sometimes the back may act up ... It's a tough road."I'm just happy to be able to go out there and watch Charlie play, or go in the backyard and have an hour or two by myself with no one talking, no music, no nothing. I just hear the birds chirping. That part I've sorely missed."JUST WATCHEDA look back at Tiger Woods' triumph, tragedy and trauma ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHA look back at Tiger Woods' triumph, tragedy and trauma  02:35Woods will be in attendance at the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas this week.
