 (CNN)The world's largest cricket stadium hosted its first Test match on Wednesday. The Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, India, hosted the third in a four-match series between India and England, the first Test match it has hosted since its refurbishment. Originally constructed in 1982 with a capacity on 42,000, an impressive renovation plan was announced in October 2015, in which the capacity was increased to 110,000 spectators. The reconstruction plan, which was completed in February 2020, meant that the stadium surpassed the Melbourne Cricket Ground -- which has a capacity of 90,000 -- to become the world's largest cricket stadium.
