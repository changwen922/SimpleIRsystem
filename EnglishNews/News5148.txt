"Law enforcement officers interrogated the victims, identified their executioners, and identified 45 members of this organized criminal group. In September this year, materials on eight war criminals were sent to court for absentee sentencing."Kulikovsky was detained after police received information that he had arrived in territory controlled by Ukraine, the ministry statement said.The fact he is already in the hands of Ukrainian law enforcement officers is the result of joint work of the National Police and the Security Service of Ukraine, Monastyrsky said.
