"I must confess it is an off-label administration basically, as usual, we are testing it on our employees," Logunov told Putin in a televised conversation after administering the booster on Sunday. Putin responded by asking Logunov whether he could "take part in this experiment."Logunov said the intranasal form was developed in order to "induce barrier immunity," which with Covid-19, "refers to our immune organs located in the nose and the pharynx.""We also know that vaccines administered through parenteral method, or intramuscular injection, are effective, but they have limited ability to induce immunity from so-called breakthrough infection and symptomatic illness. We need to deliver the agent through the mucous membranes to induce barrier immunity."According to Logunov, the nasal vaccine "just needs a little finalizing then it will go into clinical tests, and after that, we certainly plan to begin the new vaccine rollout." It is "convenient, painless, with an absolute minimum of side effects," he said.Russia has lagged behind much of the world when it comes to getting its population inoculated, despite being the first country in the world to approve a coronavirus vaccine, Sputnik V, for use in August 2020.
