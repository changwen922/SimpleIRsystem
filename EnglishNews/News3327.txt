London (CNN) -- The BBC has been forced to issue a humiliating apology after covering up the "deceitful" methods its former journalist Martin Bashir used to secure one of its biggest-ever scoops 25 years ago. Not only has the corporation's reputation taken a hit but Diana's own flesh and blood have vehemently slammed the tactics used to trick her into speaking to them, and linked the interview to her death just two years later.BBC Director-General Tim Davie said that while the British public broadcaster "cannot turn back the clock after a quarter of a century, we can make a full and unconditional apology." CNN understands letters were sent to Princes William and Harry Thursday to apologize -- but many are saying this comes decades too late.Bashir, who left his role at the BBC last week citing health reasons, released his own statement, saying it was "saddening" the controversy had "been allowed to overshadow the princess' brave decision to tell her story," according to the PA Media news agency.Lord Dyson, who carried out the independent investigation into the affair, said Diana was "keen on the idea of a television interview" around the time and "she would probably have agreed to be interviewed by any experienced and reputable reporter in whom she had confidence even without the intervention of Mr Bashir."Read MoreFrom that, we can assume the late Princess of Wales would have done a sit-down as her relationship with Charles deteriorated, but would she have said the same things? The explosive interview back in 1995 was groundbreaking for how brutally honest she was. The princess spoke of her struggles with bulimia and self-harm, and her own infidelity and that of her husband. Nothing was held back, but it's Prince William's belief that the methods used to land the interview swayed how far she went. He said: "It is my view that the deceitful way the interview was obtained substantially influenced what my mother said." Martin Bashir interviews Princess Diana in Kensington Palace for the television program "Panorama" in 1995. William's pointed, scathing and unprecedented on-camera statement does not mince words. He added, "It brings indescribable sadness to know that the BBC's failures contributed significantly to her fear, paranoia and isolation that I remember from those final years with her."His brother, Prince Harry, also speaks plainly in his condemnation of the media's tactics, saying he is deeply concerned that "practices like these -- and even worse -- are still widespread today. Then, and now, it's bigger than one outlet, one network, or one publication. Our mother lost her life because of this, and nothing has changed."And then there's Diana's brother, Earl Spencer, who goes as far as suggesting a direct link between the Bashir interview and her death. "The irony is that I met Martin Bashir on the 31 of August 1995, because exactly two years later she died. And I do draw a line between the two events," he said in a new BBC Panorama documentary broadcast on Thursday night. "It's quite clear from the introduction that I sat in on, on the 19th of September 1995, everyone was going to be made untrustworthy. And I think that Diana did lose trust in really key people."Spencer added: "This is a young girl in her mid-30s who has lived this extraordinarily turbulent, difficult time in the public eye. She didn't know who to trust. And in the end, when she died two years later, she was without any form of real protection."Princes William and Harry with their mother, Diana, in the garden of Highgrove House in Gloucestershire, England in 1986. At the point when Diana sat down with Bashir, she had been separated from Charles for some time. She was finally breaking free of the institution and regaining some control over her own life. But she was also convinced she was being undermined by her husband, the palace and the security services. It was her against the establishment. As she told Bashir, "She won't go quietly, that's the problem. I'll fight to the end, because I believe that I have a role to fulfill, and I've got two children to bring up."Diana knew exactly what she was doing when she invited Bashir in, and she didn't regret it, either, saying as much in a note she penned afterward. She had been dealing with the press for years. Much like her children and their partners today, Diana lived for years under the "intolerable" pressure of the media, but she had started repurposing it to her advantage -- to further humanitarian causes she wanted to champion. Regardless of the duplicitous way Bashir secured the sit-down, it was Diana's sincere honesty and willingness to speak truth to power that endeared her to the public.But, for her sons and brother, who still grieve her loss today, the interview as it ended up launched a "false narrative" that set in motion the events that led to her untimely death. Something Harry himself touched upon: "To those who have taken some form of accountability, thank you for owning it. That is the first step towards justice and truth."Wearing a heavy duty protection vest and face shield, Princess Diana visits a minefield in Huambo, Angola in 1997.

Harry said he drank heavily, took drugs and suffered from panic attacks while struggling to cope with the pressures of royal life in his late 20s and early 30s. "I was willing to drink, I was willing to take drugs, I was willing to try and do the things that made me feel less like I was feeling," he admitted.
