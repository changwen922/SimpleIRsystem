"There is nothing to suggest I was negligent," he said.In December, Cosachov's lawyer told CNN that his client "had used her best judgment from a medical point of view."Argentine soccer star Diego Maradona, wearing a diamond earring, balances a soccer ball on his head as he walks off the practice field following the national selection's May 22, 1986 practice session in Mexico City.READ: Diego Maradona did 'everything better and bigger, but fell more dangerously and darker''He started to die at least 12 hours prior'The experts also confirmed the results of an autopsy which determined that the cause of death was "acute pulmonary edema secondary to the exacerbation of chronic cardiac insufficiency" and tests did not find drugs or alcohol in his system.But they underlined that Maradona, who was aged 60 at the time of his death, suffered prolonged agony. "DAM started to die at least 12 hours before 12.30 p.m. on 25/11/2020, which is to say there were unmistakable signs of a period of prolonged agony, and as a result we conclude that the patient was not adequately monitored from 00:30 a.m." that day."The warning signs that the patient exhibited were ignored," continue the experts, who also mention an audio message sent to Maradona's loved ones by physical therapist Nicol√°s Taffarel."Last week I told them we had to get him up because he could develop a pulmonary edema," he said.Diego Armando Maradona, at the time head coach of Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata, greets fans prior to a match against Boca Juniors at the Alberto J.
