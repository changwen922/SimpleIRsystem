Rome (CNN)Southern Italy is bracing for two more days of devastating rain and flash flooding, as a 'medicane' storm that has deluged streets and killed two people continues to barrel through the region.Sicily's President Nello Musumeci confirmed the deaths and said a third person was missing late on Tuesday, while the mayor of the city Catania urged residents to stay home if possible."We have been through two very difficult days. We have lived through dramatic hours," mayor Salvo Pogliese said in a video posted to his Facebook page. He said the weather  was "definitely better" on Wednesday, but warned the forecast for Thursday and Friday remained "particularly worrying."  Red warnings have been issued for Wednesday and Thursday on the island of Sicily and the region containing the city of Catania, which has already been pummeled by adverse weather throughout the week.The storm comes as global leaders prepare to gather in Rome, Italy's capital, for a G20 summit.

This system is not expected to threaten the G20 talks in Rome, but adds further urgency to the ongoing effort of several countries to commit the world to tougher climate change targets.Science shows that human-made climate change is making extreme weather events, including heavy rainfall, more frequent and intense. The climate crisis is also contributing to swings between drought and floods in many places, including parts of the United States, like California, as well as the Middle East and Africa.As the Earth's atmosphere gets warmer, it can hold more moisture, which is why the world is experiencing heavier bursts of rain that it historically has. But the climate crisis is also creating longer dry spells, or drought, which leaves land and soil so dry that it can't absorb the rain as effectively as usual. This combination makes flooding more likely, and often more destructive.CNN's Angela Dewan, Sarah Dean and Monica Garrett contributed reporting
