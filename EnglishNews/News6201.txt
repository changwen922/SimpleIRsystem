 (CNN)Baylor University's women's basketball team will no longer be known as the Lady Bears. The team announced Friday that it's dropping "Lady" from its moniker, and going forward it will be referred to as the "Bears," like the university's other sports teams. "Baylor Women's Basketball has solidified itself as one of Baylor's most remarkable and celebrated programs," the school said in a statement. "While the use of Lady Bears is still very much a part of the program's decorated history, in an effort to be more consistent with the current nomenclature of the other 18 Baylor sport programs, the team will now be referred to as simply the Bears."

The name change comes as the Bears welcome a new head coach for the upcoming season. In May, Nicki Collen replaced Hall of Fame coach Kim Mulkey, who left Baylor's program to coach at Louisiana State University.
