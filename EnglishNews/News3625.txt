"I wouldn't be here without Jess. Not many people know how much she has done, but she's always there for me and she's the best travel buddy too, honestly, and I can't thank her enough and she is a huge part of why I'm here today."READ: From 'biggest setback' to 'biggest breakthrough': How Jon Rahm became a major winnerNelly Korda reacts to her putt on the 18th green as she celebrates winning the Women's PGA Championship golf tournament.A firstKorda's previous best at one of golf's majors came last year when she finished second at the ANA Inspiration.

"Hopefully we have a lot more battles, but she's had a couple of heartbreaks on Sundays and majors and she always has the greatest attitude and she's a fighter and it's a good mindset to have. "And some days it's easier than others. But I think if you go into every tournament, every round with that attitude, it just makes life so much better."
