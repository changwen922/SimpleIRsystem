Interestingly, Hamilton's deal is only for one season, and not for two, like Lewis' previous contracts with Mercedes. It certainly gives both sides options moving forward, but before that, sees the real prospect of Lewis claiming that record-breaking eighth F1 world championship. And as we saw increasingly during 2020 -- with the establishment of a new joint charitable foundation to help create "greater diversity and inclusion in motorsport" -- Mercedes continues to lead from the front as a team on those issues, while Lewis has his sights set on winning more than just trophies.
