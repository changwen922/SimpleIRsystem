Canadian Vasek Pospisil apologized for his on-court conduct and a profanity-laced rant aimed at ATP Tour chief Andrea Gaudenzi during his first-round loss to American Mackenzie McDonald at the Miami Open on Wednesday.The tantrum, which included angrily hitting a ball out of the court and shouting at the chair umpire, began when the world No. 67 smashed his racket on the court late in the first set of his 6-3 4-6 6-3 defeat.A verbal abuse penalty on set point then cost him the first set and Pospisil launched into an expletive-laden tirade against Gaudenzi, who he said had been "screaming" at him in a meeting on Tuesday for "trying to unite the players."Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and features"For an hour and a half.

"I disrespected the game I love and for that I am truly sorry."By way of explanation, I felt deeply unnerved during a meeting between players and ATP executives last night, and I underestimated the toll those emotions took on me until I stepped onto the court today."Again, I am sorry for my on-court behaviour and the language I used."The ATP Tour did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
