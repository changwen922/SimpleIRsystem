 (CNN)Novak Djokovic has been named on the entry list for next month's Australian Open, while Serena Williams has withdrawn on medical grounds. There is still uncertainty around nine-time Aussie Open champion Djokovic's participation in the tournament after players were told they would have to be fully vaccinated in order to participate. Djokovic, who is tied with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal on 20 grand slams, has not revealed his vaccination status; last month, his father said he is likely to skip the tournament over the vaccine mandate. This week, the world No. 1 was named in Serbia's team for the season-opening ATP Cup in Sydney, New South Wales. To play without being vaccinated, the state government would have to apply for an exemption for Djokovic and he would have to undergo a 14-day quarantine upon arrival.Djokovic competes for Serbia in the Davis Cup in Madrid earlier this month. Elsewhere in the men's draw, Nadal will compete for the first time since August, while last year's finalist Dominic Thiem will make a comeback from a wrist injury at Melbourne Park.
