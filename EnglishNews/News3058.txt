Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said his government will not apply for travel permits to allow unvaccinated tennis players to compete at the Australian Open in the state after Prime Minister Scott Morrison indicated they would be allowed into the country.Morrison said earlier on Wednesday that unvaccinated players would be free to compete at the grand slam after undergoing a two-week Covid-19 quarantine provided that Victoria, which hosts the tournament in Melbourne, applied for permits for them.Andrews said his state would make no such applications."On behalf of every vaccinated Victorian who has done the right thing, my government will not be applying for an exemption for any unvaccinated player," he told reporters."If we don't apply for an exemption, then no exemption will be granted and then the whole issue is basically resolved."Read MoreAustralia's borders have been effectively sealed for 18 months due to the Covid-19 pandemic, though authorities approve travel exemptions for special cases.Victoria has been Australia's hardest-hit state, with its capital Melbourne locked down six times.
