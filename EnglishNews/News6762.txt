Starting at Sandringham House, he takes in the sights and sounds of "the great British countryside, as we like to call it" while heading towards St. Mary Magdalene Church, where the royals are due to attend Christmas Day church service later this month. He ends the journey standing outside Anmer Hall, the home he shares with wife, Catherine, and their children. Reflecting on his family's annual Christmas Day pilgrimage, William talks of his "strong memories" of his grandfather plowing ahead while "there'd be us at the back with little legs trying to keep up."During the episode, the prince discusses the importance of keeping mentally fit and recalls one moment nearly a decade ago that left him sweating at a black tie event.Musing that he "can't believe I'm actually tell this story," he talks about a 2013 fundraising gala at Kensington Palace that US singers Jon Bon Jovi and Taylor Swift attended, "which nearly knocked me off my feet."Prince Charles,  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge (unseen), Prince William and Prince George arrive for the royal family's traditional Christmas Day service at St. Mary Magdalene Church in Sandringham, Norfolk, eastern England, on December 25, 2019.William says there's always "a lot of handshaking to do those nights" where he tries to "be charming and interactive." He then goes to watch the performance thinking his main tasks of the evening -- primarily to welcome guests -- are over and he can relax a little."I'm sat next to Taylor Swift. She's on my left. And after Jon does his first song, there's a pause, and she turns to me. She puts her hand on my arm, looks me in the eye, and says, 'Come on, William. Let's go and sing,'" he remembers."To this day, I still do not know what came over me. Honestly, even now I'm cringing at what happened next, and I don't understand why I gave in. But, frankly, if Taylor Swift looks you in the eye, touches your arm, and says, 'Come with me...' I got up like a puppy and went, 'Yeah, okay, that seems like a great idea. I'll follow you.'"William continues his anecdote describing walking towards the stage "in a trance" and trying to desperately remember the lyrics to "Livin' On a Prayer."The Duke of Cambridge sings with Taylor Swift and Jon Bon Jovi at the Centrepoint Gala Dinner at Kensington Palace in London, on November 26, 2013.

He details one experience helping a young boy hit by a car.William says he "went home that night pretty upset but not noticeably" and was conscious that "something had changed... a real tension inside of me." He describes compartmentalizing his feelings and returning to work but "it really hit me weeks later.""My personal life and everything was absolutely fine. I was happy at home and happy at work, but I kept looking at myself, going, 'Why am I feeling like this? Why do I feel so sad?' And I started to realize that, actually, you're taking home people's trauma, people's sadness, and it's affecting you."Prince William, left, arrives for his final shift working with the East Anglian Air Ambulance as a pilot at Cambridge Airport, eastern England on July 27, 2017.

"And my mother, she'd be driving along, singing at the top of her voice. And we'd even get the policeman in the car, he'd be occasionally singing along, as well."These days, the father-of-three says he's amazed that his own children "already have inherited my family's love of music.""One of the songs that the children are loving at the moment is Shakira, 'Waka Waka,'" he explains.
