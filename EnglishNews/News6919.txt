The containers came on a ship from Paraguay, via Tangier and Rotterdam, the police said.It was "pretty disgusting to separate the cocaine from the putty as it is so sticky,"  Matschke told CNN, adding that the the drugs would have a street value of several billion euros.Read MorePolice say the cocaine seizure is the largest ever confiscated in Europe.The Dutch police said a "risk analysis" they carried out led German authorities to check the three containers on February 12.Dutch authorities said that following that seizure, they began an investigation into the recipient of the Hamburg shipment, which led them to 11 containers on their way from Panama to Antwerp, ostensibly filled with pineapple, mackerel, squid and wood.Belgian authorities on Saturday found 7,200 kilograms (15,873 pounds) of cocaine in the container carrying blocks of wood, according to the Dutch police."The intercepted mega-shipments to the Netherlands together form an absolute record," the Dutch police said in a statement.
