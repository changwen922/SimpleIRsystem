"So it wasn't an imitation it was a mark of respect to one of my idols. I probably didn't do the celebration justice and didn't execute it properly."Andros Townsend scores Everton's equalizer against Manchester United in the 1-1 Premier League draw.The draw means Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side have managed to win just two of their last six games in all competitions."We started well and scored a fantastic goal. In the second half we lacked a cutting edge to get a second. From our corner we concede five seconds later, which is too much to have," Solskjaer told BT Sport."We had enough players behind the ball, but did not deal with things. We didn't regroup and reorganise well enough."Anthony Martial gave Manchester United a first-half lead against Everton.Everton were missing a number of key players through injury -- notably strikers Richarlison and Dominic Cavert-Lewin -- and the Merseyside club's manager Rafa Benitez said the draw felt "mentally like a victory.""To come here and perform in the way we did, we were really close," Benitez told BT Sport. "You have to be really proud of the players."We were doing well, it's a pity we conceded as we were working really hard. In the second half we reacted well and had chances to win the game."Andros [Townsend] is doing well, but the team has won, not just one player doing well, and he was fantastic. The rest of the team worked hard with a fantastic performance."
