 (CNN)Anna Nordqvist was supposed to be getting married in a castle in Scotland, but because of the Covid-19 pandemic, she and her husband had a smaller ceremony at home in Arizona, US, with guests watching over Zoom instead.While the smaller ceremony was "special," Nordqvist says she can't wait to "walk down the aisle again in Scotland next year, as she spoke about life on and off the golf course after claiming a momentous Women's Open title at Carnoustie.Fresh off her comeback major victory -- her first professional triumph in almost four years -- Nordqvist was in reflective mood as she talked about the challenges she has faced on the women's tours in the US and Europe.Before her Carnoustie success, she had last won at the Evian Championship in 2017, and subsequently faced battles on and off the course during her barren run.The Swedish golfer slipped out of the top 50 world rankings, finishing in the top 10 just once in the 19 majors she had competed in.Read MoreNordqvist poses with the Women's Open trophy at Carnoustie.Things got so bad that the 34-year-old doubted if she would ever win again, Nordqvist admitted after lifting aloft the Women's Open trophy and picking up the winner's check of $870,000 as part of the new largest prize fund in women's major championship golf.And as she struggled for form -- as well as overcoming a bout of mononucleosis -- Nordqvist revealed the "hardest part" was losing her "mental and physical endurance."Mono is a contagious disease with symptoms which include extreme fatigue, fever, sore throat and head and body aches amongst others, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "I think last year during Covid, I finally had some time to be at home and slow down," she told the media in her press conference after winning the Women's Open."My life has always gone at 110 miles an hour. Great to finally have a little bit more time at home and not having to travel. I think [that] was probably the break I needed a couple years ago and just never gave myself."It was hard because I kept pushing but it was hard because it was like your feet kept slipping and I didn't have that extra gear I was always used to."When things got tough, I could always push it through mentally, but I just never had anything and I just felt really weak. So to be able to build myself back up again and have the support of people around me [felt great]."READ: The power of three: How Arnold Palmer, Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus revolutionized golfNordqvist looks on during the third round of the 2020 Women's PGA Championship.'Most special one'The phrase "bursting onto the scene" is an apt phrase to describe Nordqvist's start to life in golf.In just her fifth start on the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) Tour, she won her first professional tournament which also happened to be a major.Aged just 22, Nordqvist finished four shots ahead of second-placed Lindsey Wright to win the 2009 LPGA Championship.
