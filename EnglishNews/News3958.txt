 (CNN)We could be set for one of the most thrilling La Liga finales in history, after Ousmane Dembele's injury-time goal gave Barcelona a narrow 1-0 win over Valladolid on Monday and moved the Catalan club to within a point of league leader Atletico Madrid.With Real Madrid just two points further back, it means Spain's "Big Three" are now separated by just three points as teams enter the final stretch of the season.Atletico had enjoyed a comfortable lead at La Liga's summit after a blistering start to the season, while both Barcelona and Real struggled to find form in the opening weeks. However, the pressure appears to be getting to Diego Simeone's side, which has now won just two of its last five La Liga matches.Barcelona, conversely, is on a blistering run and hasn't tasted defeat domestically since the beginning of December, while Zinedine Zidane's Real has lost just once since the end of November.Though there was an element of good fortune to Dembele's goal -- the ball falling kindly after bouncing between two heads in the penalty area -- it was nothing less than Barcelona deserved for its superiority throughout the 90 minutes.Read MoreREAD: 'More than a Club?'
