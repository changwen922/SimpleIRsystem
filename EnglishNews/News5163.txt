While our bus contained no references to Israel, we were clearly a Jewish group. The young men who surrounded us were not engaged in political protest; this was a bigoted anti-Semitic attack in the heart of London, seen by dozens of others, who stood by silently," Glitsenstein said in a statement published by the Chabad Israeli Center Golders Green.We must combat anti-Semitic hate crimes with solidarity, not violence The rabbi said that around 40 young people had gathered to mark the second night of Hanukkah aboard an "open-air party bus." He said the night turned sour after a group of men approached them as they were dancing in Oxford Street, in central London. "They (the men) quickly became aggressive and began making profane gestures and yelling 'Free Palestine!'" Glitsenstein said, adding that as soon as his group returned to the bus, the "young men began shouting profanities at the group, throwing at least one projectile on the top of the bus, spitting at the bus, and banging on the windows with their shoes."After the bus drove off, the "Hanukkah party on wheels" continued, Glitsenstein added.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson described the footage as "disturbing." "Racism of any kind will never be tolerated in our society and we will continue to do all we can to root it out," Johnson said in a tweet on Thursday.London Mayor Sadiq Khan said in a tweet on Wednesday that "antisemitism has no place whatsoever in society and I utterly condemn these disgusting acts. No one should have to experience this. If you have any information about this incident, I urge you to report it."
