Piotr Perzenowski, 30, has since been charged with smuggling the shipment, and appeared at Kent's Folkestone Magistrates' Court on Saturday morning. "This was a really significant amount of drugs taken out of circulation," NCA's branch commander Mark Howes said."The seizure will deprive the organised crime group responsible for them of profit which would have fuelled more offending," Howes added.
