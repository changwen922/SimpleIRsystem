A version of this story appeared in the August 6 edition of CNN's Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on the royal family, what they are up to in public and what's happening behind palace walls. Sign up here.London (CNN)Why are people so fascinated by royalty? For some it's the mystique, while it's the curiosity factor for others.  Meghan and Harry have done a lot to expose the inner workings of the British monarchy and show that life as a royal isn't all it's cracked up to be. But, if anything, this has only increased interest.With television, radio, podcasts, the internet, social media platforms and the rest of our overly saturated media landscape, people want more and more. Harry promises to deliver with the memoir he's working on, but in the meantime, people will take anything they can on royal life.Take this week's news that Meghan is marking her 40th birthday by launching a female mentorship initiative. She did so with a sleek, beautifully lit video, apparently filmed at the couple's Montecito mansion. The moment offered royal-watchers a glimpse into her new home in California and the chance to spot Easter eggs (like her star sign necklaces) and other subtle nods in the background, which the press pounced upon.Elle magazine wrote: "Meghan Markle gives rare glimpse inside her Montecito home and invitation to mentor for her 40th birthday." The UK's Daily Telegraph broke down the "Twelve hidden messages in the Sussexes' stylish study." While British online newspaper the Independent highlighted Meghan's "spacious desk," which "included room for a quartz crystal, placed on one corner, a gold vase filled with white flowers, a decorative glass bottle, and two white and gold trays, while viewers also noticed that the desk held multiple framed photos of Meghan's family."Read MoreNo detail was too small."In the corner closest to Meghan, the desk held a decorative tray bearing a plate of cookies and a teacup," the Independent write-up added. These tidbits may seem trivial but they're part of a strategy used by royals (and celebrities, if we're honest) to connect with their audience and find common ground. Do you share a home furnishing color palette with the Sussexes? Are you also a cookie monster? If so, you're connected -- there's an unspoken bond.Meghan has been in the spotlight long enough to know how the media and public will respond to moments like this. And critics may question why she allowed cameras into her home, given her well-publicized concerns about media privacy. But she's also aware that it's her profile that allows her voice to carry so far.There is a cost to her privacy that she is willing to accept to promote her work. And she's hardly the first royal to do so. One of the more recent examples was Princess Anne offering up a peek at her pretty normal-looking living room as she watched some rugby on TV, while news outlets routinely unpick the decor in the background of the Queen's annual Christmas message.In offering herself up in the short but sweet sketch on her milestone birthday, Meghan's got us talking about her underlying but vastly more important message: supporting women in the post-pandemic workforce. Which is exactly what she would have hoped for. Now that she's in complete control of her publicity, we're getting a sense of where Meghan is drawing the line on how far she will let people in.WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING?Kate's portraits of Holocaust survivors.The Duchess of Cambridge says she is "honoured" to have her own photographs of Holocaust survivors and their families form part of a new exhibition in London.
