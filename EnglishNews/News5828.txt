We never take any opposition lightly.

"You don't win by 10 wickets if you don't outplay the opposition. We did not even get any chances. They were very professional and you definitely have to give them credit."Kohli said the team tried to put pressure on them but "they had the answers."

"That's a good thing to know where you went wrong as a team, so that we can work on it and try and correct it and move forward."Kohli said there were still a lot of matches left in the tournament. "If we stick to the process we follow, we definitely feel like we can overcome these mistakes," he added.
