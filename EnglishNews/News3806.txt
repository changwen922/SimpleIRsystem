 (CNN)The Atlanta Braves are now just one win away from the franchise's first MLB championship since 1995, after winning Game 4 of the World Series on Saturday. Highlighted by back-to-back 7th inning home runs from shortstop Dansby Swanson and a pinch-hitting Jorge Soler, the Braves edged the visiting Astros 3-2 to take a commanding 3-1 lead. Atlanta can capture the crown in front of their home crowd on Sunday night."I just want to win tomorrow. I don't know how confident I am," Braves manager Brian Snitker said when asked how he felt being 3-1 up."I'm glad we are, quite honestly. I'd rather be up three than down three, I guess. But I've been around too long to get ahead of myself."Read MoreTrump participates in 'Tomahawk chop' at World Series gameHouston had most of the momentum in the game's early innings but failed to capitalize on scoring opportunities.The Astros stranded 11 baserunners and its hitters were 0-for-8 with runners in scoring position.Atlanta starter Dylan Lee registered just a single out, handing the ball over to Kyle Wright with the bases loaded in the first inning.

We know what we have to do. We have to win tomorrow."Former President Donald Trump was in attendance at Game 4 and participated in the controversial "Tomahawk chop" on Saturday.The chop -- a stadium-wide chant and longtime tradition at Braves games -- has been under renewed scrutiny as part of a national discussion about racism and racial imagery in professional sports.Several advocacy groups and observers have accused the chant of mocking Native American groups and decried it as racist. But many Braves fans, including Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, have dismissed the criticism, and the stadium has led the fans in doing the chant in both Games 3 and 4 of the series.
