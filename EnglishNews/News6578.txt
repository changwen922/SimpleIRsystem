 (CNN)India cricket captain Virat Kohli has criticized the "spineless people on social media" who attacked the team's bowler Mohammed Shami over his religion following the team's loss to Pakistan in a T20 World Cup match."To me, attacking someone over their religion is the most pathetic thing that a human being can do," Kohli told reporters in a press conference Saturday, ahead of India's Sunday match against New Zealand."Everyone has the right to voice their opinion and what they feel about a certain situation, but I personally have never ever even thought of discriminating anyone over their religion -- and that is a very sacred and a personal thing to every human being, and that should be left there," he added.
