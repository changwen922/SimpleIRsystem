The plane made an emergency landing in Omsk.Read MoreMaximishin did not give any press briefings at the time of Navalny's hospitalization. As the hospital's deputy chief physician for anesthesiology and resuscitation, he was one of the most senior doctors at the hospital.Putin dismissed Navalny for years, but outrage over his jailing is now a big problem for the KremlinNavalny was put into a medically induced coma and eventually evacuated to the German capital of Berlin, where he spent five months recovering from the poisoning. After returning to Russia, he was arrested, and was sentenced to prison this week for violating probation terms of a previous sentence. The verdict sparked swift condemnation abroad, including the US. Navalny blames his poisoning on Russian security services and on President Vladimir Putin himself, accusations that the Kremlin has repeatedly denied. A CNN-Bellingcat investigation in December has implicated the Russian Security Service (FSB) in the attack. Navalny also duped one of the agents into revealing that he was poisoned with the nerve agent Novichok applied to his underwear.Leonid Volkov, Navalny's chief of staff, confirmed Maximishin was in charge of treating the opposition leader. "Sergey Maximishin was the head of department that treated Alexey Navalny and was in charge of his treatment -- specifically his medically induced coma," Volkov told CNN. "(Maximishin) knew more than anyone else about Alexey's condition so I can't dismiss possibility of foul play," he added. "However Russia's health care system is very poor and it's not uncommon for doctors of his age to suddenly die. I doubt there will any investigation into his death," Volkov continued.

"He brought people back to full reality. We will miss Dr. Maximishin very much. He left too early and because of this the pain of loss is especially bitter," Alexander Murakhovsky said in a statement.
