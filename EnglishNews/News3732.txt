A version of this story appeared in the May 14 edition of CNN's Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on the royal family, what they are up to in public and what's happening behind palace walls. Sign up here. London (CNN) -- This year's State Opening of Parliament was a stripped-down affair, like every other public event these days. No carriages or robes for the Queen, and the Palace of Westminster felt like a ghost town on what is usually its busiest day of the year. Particularly poignant was the absence of the throne Prince Philip traditionally sat in as consort.There was never any doubt over the 95-year-old's attendance following her husband's death. The sovereign is one of the constituent parts of the British parliament, alongside the House of Commons and House of Lords. The State Opening is the one day every year that those three parts come together. It is the Queen's constitutional duty to attend but it's also one of those annual appearances that make her part of the rhythm of public life. She knows that if she didn't appear, it would disrupt that rhythm and undermine her other duty, to represent continuity and stability for the nation -- and it's in desperate need of that right now (You can watch the full speech here).The Queen follows the Imperial State Crown along the royal gallery during the State Opening of Parliament at the House of Lords on Tuesday.

The diamond sits below the Black Prince's Ruby, which is said to have been worn by Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. The sheer value of the jewels in the crown makes it priceless even before you consider the history of the gems or what the overall piece represents.Read MoreOn the Queen's right is the Imperial State Crown.Other than the Queen, only two people are allowed to touch the crown. They are the Archbishop of Canterbury, whose job it is to crown the monarch, and the Crown Jeweller, who is responsible for its upkeep and its security every time it's removed from the Tower of London.It would make everyone a lot less anxious if the crown never left its vault, but this isn't a museum item. It's the working symbol of a living, breathing constitutional monarchy. The State Opening is a visual reminder of what the UK is, or at least how it works.

Her Majesty was speaking to the Royal Life Saving Society, reminiscing about achieving her own life-saving award in 1941."It was of course all done in the Bath Club [in London], in the swimming pool. I suppose I didn't really actually realize quite what I was doing because I think I must have been 12 or something. 12 or 14? It's a very long time ago, I'm afraid."The then-Princess Elizabeth wins a life-saving award at the Children's Challenge Shield Competition, held at the Royal Bath Club in London on June 28, 1939. Then Clive Holland, deputy Commonwealth president of the society, chimed in to inform the monarch: "Your Majesty, when you say it was a long time ago, it was in fact 80 years ago," to which Elizabeth chuckled: "That's terrible."Holland continued, "We know that you were actually the first holder of the award." That news seemed to take the Queen by surprise. She replied: "I didn't realize I was the first one. I just did it and had to work very hard for it. But it was a great achievement, and I was very proud to wear the badge on the front of my swimming suit."IN THE ROYAL DIARYWilliam and Kate's UK radio takeover on Friday: The Cambridges joined a bevy of British celebs for the Mental Health Minute, a 60-second message broadcast simultaneously on more than 500 radio stations across the UK to "encourage everyone to keep the conversation on mental health going."

"This last year I know has been deeply challenging for us all, I'm only too aware of the impact of the pandemic on the Muslim community.
