 (CNN)As Week 9 of the NFL season gets underway, here are five things to look out for in the upcoming games. Green Bay Packers travel to hostile Arrowhead Stadium without QB Aaron RodgersWith Covid-19 positive (and unvaccinated) quarterback Aaron Rodgers watching from home, the Green Bay Packers will visit the defending AFC champion Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday.In Rodgers' place will be second-year quarterback Jordan Love, making his first ever NFL start. With 68 career passing yards and no touchdowns thrown, Love is some way behind three-time NFL MVP Rodgers' 53,071 yards and 429 touchdowns.The Green Bay Packers sport an NFL-leading 7-1 record, but the 4-4 Kansas City Chiefs have begun to find their form and will be desperate for a win to climb back into the AFC West race.Love warms up before the Packers' game against the Arizona Cardinals last month.

AFC North grudge match with a key absenceCross-state rivals Cincinnati Bengals and Cleveland Browns will square off in The Queen City.This rivalry never lacks intensity, but this year the AFC North is one of the most tightly bunched divisions in the NFL with all four teams still firmly in contention.The Cleveland Browns announced on Friday that the team had released star wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr., who had been disgruntled of late over his role with the team. Beckham caught seven touchdowns in 29 games during his tenure with the Browns."After careful consideration, internal discussions and conversations with Odell and his representation, we've determined that it is in the best interest of all parties involved that Odell no longer play for the Cleveland Browns," Browns General Manager Andrew Berry said in a statement. "We appreciate all his efforts and contributions while in Cleveland, but we've just reached a point where it is best that we move forward as a team without Odell. We are finalizing the process of granting Odell his release and we wish him well as he continues his career."Odell Beckham Jr. was released by the Browns this week. Draft position on the line for two of the league's worst teamsFor a pair of teams well out of playoff contention, there is still something to play for (and maybe to lose for).When the 1-7 Houston Texans head to South Florida to face the 1-7 Miami Dolphins, the loser will emerge with the second-worst record in the NFL.That will put the loser hot on the heels of the 0-8 Detroit Lions for the top pick in next spring's NFL Draft. The Lions are mercifully on their bye in Week 9.READ: Kansas City Chiefs edge past New York GiantsFive Super Bowl rematchesAmong the remained week 9 NFL games, there are five repeats of previous Super Bowl match-ups.
