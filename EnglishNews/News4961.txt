 (CNN)Seattle Seahawks' wide receiver DK Metcalf's speed went viral last season when he ran the full length of the pitch to catch an opponent during an NFL game, but he isn't quite quick enough for the Tokyo Olympics. Metcalf competed in the 100 meters at Sunday's USA Track and Field Golden Games and Distance Open in Walnut, California, in an attempt to qualify for next month's US Olympic trials.The 6ft 4in, 235lbs man mountain clocked a respectable time of 10.36 seconds, finishing ninth in his heat and 15th overall in the field of 17, meaning he won't be traveling to Japan and will instead focus solely on preparing for the upcoming season. "To test my speed up against world class athletes ... just having the opportunity to run against these guys was a blessing," said Metcalf after Sunday's race. "They do this for a living. This is very different from football speed."Read MoreMetcalf warms up prior to the Men's 100-meter race.Cravon Gillespie won the race with a time of 10.11 seconds.
