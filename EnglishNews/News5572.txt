 (CNN)Fresh off breaking onto the biggest stage possible with her debut grand slam victory, Emma Raducanu is enjoying the success that comes with it. Upon her return to the UK following her US Open victory earlier in September, the 18-year-old picked up one of the most famous doubles partners imaginable. In an event commemorating Raducanu and other British champions from Flushing Meadows, she took to the court with the Duchess of Cambridge in London.

However, during the event Friday, she announced that she has split with coach Andrew Richardson following her win. Richardson accompanied Raducanu for the US Open, coaching her on her remarkable journay to the grand slam title. However, she says she is now looking for a more experienced coach. "Where I was at after Wimbledon, I was ranked around 200 in the world, and at the time, I thought Andrew would be a great coach to trial so we went to the States but never did I even dream of winning the US Open and having the run I did and now I'm ranked 22 in the world, which is pretty crazy to me," she said. The Duchess of Cambridge plays a game of tennis with Raducanu."I feel like at this stage in my career, and playing the top players in the world, I realized I really need someone right now that has had that WTA Tour experience at the high levels, which means that I'm looking for someone who has been at that level and knows what it takes."And especially right now because I'm so new to it, I really need someone to guide me who's already been through that."
