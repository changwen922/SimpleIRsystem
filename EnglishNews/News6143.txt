 (CNN)Deandre Ayton tipped-in a dramatic last-second pass to give the Phoenix Suns a 104-103 Game Two victory over the Los Angeles Clippers on Tuesday. With just 0.7 seconds left on the clock, Ayton received an alley-oop pass from Jae Crowder and finished it off with aplomb. It means the Suns race into a 2-0 lead in the Western Conference finals -- despite still missing star guard Chris Paul, after he was placed in the league's health and safety protocol after testing positive for Covid-19 -- as they aim for their first trip to the NBA Finals in 28 years. "The celebration was a little shaky because I wasn't too sure what I did," Ayton told reporters after the game. "I wasn't sure if it counted, I didn't want to be a blooper, none of that.
