"It's obviously a massive moment for me. I'll remember this one for a long time."Chelsea head coach Thomas Tuchel added: "It was a good performance. We were sharp and put in a lot of effort. "The offensive guys need goals to feel fully happy and ... so this will help a lot. He [Mount] waited long, too long so it was good he got some goals."
