 (CNN)In his three-time NBA title winning career, Steph Curry has put in some dominant performances. However, he might have eclipsed them all on Sunday night in the Golden State Warriors' 137-122 win over the Portland Trailblazers. Curry scored a career-high 62 points in his 36 minutes on the floor, finishing 18-for-31 from the field, 8-for-16 from three-point range, 18-of-19 from the free throw line, and had five rebounds and four assists. Afterwards, Curry called it a "pretty crazy night."

"Just a brilliant performance," Warriors coach Kerr told reporters afterward. "We've seen Steph do so many things over the years. It's just a privilege to coach him. It really is. And not just because of his talent, but because of the way he carries himself and the way he leads. We are incredibly blessed as an organization to have Steph leading the way."Both the Warriors and the Trailblazers have a 3-3 record in the early stages of the season.
