 (CNN)New Zealand batsman Devon Conway will miss the T20 World Cup final against Australia on Sunday after breaking his hand by punching his bat. An x-ray confirmed Conway had broken a fifth metacarpal in his right hand after hitting his bat out of frustration following his dismissal in his team's semifinal win against England on Wednesday. "He's absolutely gutted to be ruled out like this at this time," New Zealand head coach Gary Stead said in a statement.
