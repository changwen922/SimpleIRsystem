 (CNN)The French rugby federation (FFR) has voted unanimously in favor of allowing transgender women to play women's rugby as of next season. The decision goes against advice given by World Rugby, who last year said it did not recommend that transgender women play women's contact rugby "on safety grounds at the international level of the game." However, the governing body's advice was not binding and allowed national federations to implement their own grassroots policy.

Those players who have already transitioned and have changed their civil record can play without preconditions. The FFR is the first national federation in France to allow transgender women to compete in top level sport.
