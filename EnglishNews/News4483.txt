Yet to win a major at that point, DeChambeau made a comment about Koepka's physique, saying on a Fortnite Twitch stream: "In the Body Issue, he didn't have any abs. I got some abs." Koepka replied with a picture of his four major trophies -- two from the US Open and two from the PGA Championship -- with the caption: "You were right @b_dechambeau I am 2 short of a 6 pack!"Earlier this year, a video clip of Koepka losing his train of thought "hearing that bulls**t" as DeChambeau walked behind him in the middle of an interview at May's PGA Championship took the feud up a notch.Koepka rolls his eyes and loses his train of thought as DeChambeau walks behind him at the 2021 PGA Championship.

Like, you know, it's just kind of softball on me," said DeChambeau. "I guess you could say he's trying to go through and use social media as a platform to, to mess with me and no, we're going to settle on the golf course."Now that they are both major winners and victorious Ryder Cup teammates, it'll be fascinating TV to see how the two fair against one another.
