"Really, really, really. And by the way, when I was down in New Zealand, not long ago, I was bragging about you guys, they almost didn't let me off the island, you know what I mean? Congratulations, fellas!" "Anyway, we are gigantic fans. The three of us, when we were in law school and college, but not like you guys, man," Biden added.
