After some examinations and observation, he was discharged on Tuesday."I don't really remember (what happened). My refereeing colleagues told me that I gave him a yellow card. He punched me in the face, I fell to the ground, got kicked, and passed out," Crivellaro told a local radio station."This player needs treatment because he is totally out of control. He deserves to be arrested for a long time."Rio Grande do Sul state released a statement on Monday saying it had opened an investigation into the incident, while Sport Club Sao Paulo said that its "deeply ashamed" of the aggression and that Ribeiro´s contract had been ended."The aggressor athlete's contract is summarily terminated.
