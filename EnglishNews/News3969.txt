"It's been recorded. In words and numbers, in trophies and titles, in records and in headlines. It's in the Museum at the Bernabéu Stadium and it's also in the minds of every fan of the club."And beyond what I achieved, I remember that in those nine years I had a relationship of deep affection and respect for 'merengue afición,' an affection and respect that I retain to this day, and that I will always cherish.Read More"I know that the true Real Madrid fans will continue to have me in their hearts, and I will have them in mine."Juventus' Cristiano Ronaldo looks on during the Joan Gamper Trophy match between Barcelona and Juve at the Estadi Johan Cruyff on August 08, 2021 in Barcelona.'I remain focused on my career'On Tuesday, Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti tweeted that although Ronaldo was "a Real Madrid legend and he has all my affection and respect," he never considered signing the forward.During Euro 2020, Ronaldo equaled the all-time international goalscoring record of 109 international goals set by Iran's Ali Daei.Nonetheless, since joining Juventus on a four-year deal for a reported $117 million transfer fee in 2018, the 36-year-old has been unable to lead the Italian team to a Champions League title, a competition he won four times with Real Madrid.Ronaldo in action during the preseason friendly between Juve and Atalanta in Turin, Italy.Ronaldo won the Serie A title in his first two seasons with the Old Lady, but last season the club finished fourth as Inter Milan took the Scudetto, which perhaps explains the speculation."As well as this most recent episode in Spain, there have been frequent news and stories associating me with a number of clubs in many different Leagues, with nobody ever being concerned about trying to find out the actual truth," Ronaldo said in his Instagram post."I'm breaking my silence now to say that I can't allow people to keep playing around with my name.
