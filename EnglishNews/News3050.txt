 (CNN)German Chancellor Angela Merkel has walked back on her plan to impose a new hard lockdown during the upcoming Easter holiday, apologizing for causing confusion over the restrictions and saying the issue was "singularly and alone" her mistake.Facing criticism over her plan for the five-day lockdown, Merkel said Wednesday, just a day after the initial announcement, that she was rescinding the order to label the Thursday and Saturday before Easter "rest days."The change means most businesses will no longer be forced to close on those two days, although other restrictions on social contact and gatherings will remain. Businesses will be closed as usual on the public holidays of Good Friday, Easter Sunday and Easter Monday.Germany should have led the world at handling the pandemic. But experts slam Merkel's vaccine response as a disaster"To put it bluntly, the idea of an Easter shutdown was designed with the best of intentions; because we absolutely must succeed in slowing down and reversing the third wave of the pandemic," she said during a hastily organized press conference at the German Chancellery on Wednesday."Nevertheless ... it was not implementable well enough in the short time available," she added, saying she "deeply regretted" causing additional uncertainty at the time Germany finds itself in the middle of the third wave of the pandemic which she said was caused by the new, more contagious variant of the virus.Read MoreGermany's Merkel warns of third wave if lockdown is lifted too quicklyGermany is currently battling a surge in infections.

"The road is hard and it is rocky; it is marked by successes, but also by mistakes and setbacks," she said. "But the virus will slowly but surely lose its terror."
