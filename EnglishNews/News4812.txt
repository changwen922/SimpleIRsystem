ParisThe French prosecutor's department has said that there were no grounds to pursue legal claims that France bore responsibility for enabling the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.On Monday, France's top prosecutor, Remy Heitz, said in a statement that investigations carried out by French authorities could not prove any complicity by French troops in the killings, which were orchestrated by Rwanda's Hutu-led government.Ever since the genocide, critics of France's role have said that then French President Francois Mitterrand failed to prevent the massacres or even supported the Hutu-led government.Rwanda last month published a report in which it said that France was aware that genocide was being prepared in Rwanda ahead of the killings."The French Government bears significant responsibility for enabling a foreseeable genocide," the Rwandan government said in its 600-page report, prepared by the US law firm Levy Firestone Muse and published on Rwanda's main governmental website.

(...) It reacted late with Operation Turquoise, which saved many lives, but not those of the vast majority of Tutsi in Rwanda, who were exterminated in the first weeks of the genocide," the report added. "Research, therefore, establishes a set of responsibilities, heavy and overwhelming."The Rwandan government has previously accused French officials of complicity, and French soldiers of rape and assassinations. The French government denied these claims, although former President Nicolas Sarkozy acknowledged "mistakes" in 2010.
