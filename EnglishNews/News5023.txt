 (CNN)Brazil's bright yellow jersey is a symbol that unites the country through a love of football and national pride, but over the past two years the shirt's adoption by right wing supporters of Jair Bolsonaro, who wear it at protests and rallies to show their political allegiance to the Brazilian president, is causing controversy.That famous yellow jersey was burnt into the imagination of a global audience in the 1970 World Cup. Inspired by the spelbinding performances of Pelé -- he wore the number 10 jersey  -- the yellow shirt has represented Brazil's success on the pitch and created a positive image worldwide for the past five decades.That 1970 national team also became embroiled in politics, notably ahead of the World Cup in Mexico when General Medici, the president of a nation under military dictatorship, played a key role in the removal of the coach -- Joao Saldanha -- who had overseen a perfect qualification campaign.Fast forward to 2020 and critics of Bolsonaro say the iconic yellow jersey has now become tainted by its close association to the Brazilian president.

Casagrande's sentiments lie on the left side of the political chasm separating Bolsonaro's supporters and opponents, and he feels an item he cherishes is being misrepresented."Now I consider the Brazilian yellow jersey to have been kidnapped and appropriated by the right wing, so we cannot use it." Casagrande said that for him the power of the yellow shirt used to be that it represented democracy and freedom."Brazil is appearing horribly to the world right now," he said. "It's the first time in my life I'm seeing the yellow jersey being used against democracy and freedom."

As a Bolsonaro supporter, Alexandre brushes off accusations that the jersey's symbolism is being manipulated, and says the reason for supporters to wear a yellow t-shirt is simple: everyone in Brazil has a yellow t-shirt.He points out that supporters don't always wear the Brazilian team jersey specifically, and rallies are full of people wearing yellow t-shirts of all kinds.  Alexandre says there is a separation between the jersey's sporting reputation and associations from what it politically represents."Around the world everybody knows about the Brazilian soccer team, so even if I go to a fight and I use the yellow soccer team shirt, everyone knows it's Brazil," he said. "So it's not about politics -- it's just that the world knows about soccer in Brazil."It may be easier for some than others to isolate football and politics in a country where football is God.Josemar de Rezende Jr. is a football fan who co-founded a Bolsonaro volunteer group in his city before the election. He said he's proud of the Brazilian team's global reputation for winning, and to him the yellow jersey "means love for the country, leadership, achievement and pride."Supporters of President Jair Bolsonaro rally against current Rio de Janeiro Governor Wilson Witzel on May 31, 2020 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.Supporters of Brazilian President Jair Messias Bolsonaro gather in support of him and to protest against racism and the death of blacks in the slums of Brazil during a Black Lives Matter protest on Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro on June 7, 2020.READ: The mystery of the 1998 World Cup finalWhite and blue kit campaignNonetheless, the subject of the yellow jersey has become so divisive that a campaign is underway for Brazil to play in a white shirt.João Carlos Assumpção, a Brazilian journalist, filmmaker and author of "Gods of Soccer," a book about the political, sociological and economic history of Brazil, is leading a campaign for the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) to abandon the yellow jersey altogether and go back to the classic white and blue kit from when the program started in 1914.CNN reached out to the CBF who responded that they choose not to comment on this matter, "as it is a very unique issue.""People used to love Brazilian soccer because we used to play very well," Assumpção said, "and if we play well with the white shirt in 2022 I think everybody's going to buy a white shirt. It's going to be very difficult to change, but I think it's not impossible."A supporter of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro cries during a demonstration in favor of his government amidst the coronavirus pandemic in front of Planalto Palace on May 24, 2020 in Brasilia, Brazil.

"Not the changes that this government is doing," Assumpção clarified. On the other side of the political spectrum, the color yellow, including the yellow jersey, represents a positive change in the country.

Except it is not contained by city boundaries and in recent months has brought fans together. São Paulo is home to four main clubs: Corinthians, Palmeiras, São Paolo, and Santos. The rivalry between Corinthians and Palmeiras is especially intense, and in June groups from each club joined together in the streets to counter-protest Bolsonaro's supporters.  Sociologist Rafael Castilho, a Member of the Collective Corinthian Democracy  and Coordinator of the Corinthians Study Center said that for Brazil to overcome the current political situation, it will have to "unite different ways of thinking and accept the contradictory."Castilho explains the civic responsibility rival clubs feel to support each other and join with civil society movements, "as the country experiences a crisis of party representation and social movements have been intimidated by police action," he said,  adding that "the attitude of fans has gained sympathy because part of society feels represented by the courage of the fans."The Corinthians have a history of mixing football and politics. In the 1980s during the pro-democracy movement called Diretas Já, the club team was led by national team leaders Socrates and Casagrande.The two intertwined football with politics when the team wore jerseys during a game in 1982 displaying the words "VOTE on 15th," in an effort to motivate their fans to vote in the São Paulo state government election. Two years later the Corinthians were the center of a movement called Democracia Corintiana, which Casagrande said put more than one million people in the streets dressed in yellow."It was a very important moment for Brazilian democracy, and this yellow jersey was central to that movement," Casagrande said.JUST WATCHEDPelé and who else?

A year before the World Cup was to take place in the South American country, conservative protesters wore shirts that represented the colors of Brazil, while leftist protesters used other colors.  Alexandre and Rezende Jr. both say that yellow is an improvement from the red t-shirts government supporters used to wear when the left was in power, alluding to an underlying support of communism.

Not now."
