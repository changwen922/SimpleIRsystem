 (CNN)The Australian state of Victoria has extended its lockdown for another three weeks after tough restrictions failed to lower the number of daily new coronavirus cases.Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews says restrictions will only ease when 70% of eligible residents receive their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine. That's expected to happen on or around September 23. So far, 56% of people aged 16 and above have received their first dose."What we must do is suppress case numbers sufficiently to buy us time to get people vaccinated. What that means is that we can't ease restrictions today in any profound way," Andrews said. "We are in for a difficult time, a challenging time over these coming weeks."Read MoreVictoria recorded 120 new cases on Wednesday, up from 76 on Tuesday, but substantially less than the 1,116 cases recorded in neighboring New South Wales, which also reported four new deaths.The leaders of both states concede they will not be able to eliminate the virus and are racing to vaccinate their populations before removing most lockdown restrictions, in line with the national plan.
