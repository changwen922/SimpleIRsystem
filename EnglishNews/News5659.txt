 (CNN)The English Premier League outlined on Wednesday sanctions for the six clubs -- Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham -- involved in the breakaway Super League that was announced in April. The Super League wanted to guarantee 15 clubs a place in a 20-team competition every season, regardless of performance on the pitch.Criticism from fans was instant and fierce, as protests popped up around the grounds of the clubs involved and the project imploded. In a statement, and described as a "gesture of goodwill", the six clubs have agreed to pay a combined total of $31 million that "will go towards the good of the game, including new investment in support for fans, grassroots football and community programs." New rule changes have also been supported by the clubs involved "so that any similar actions in the future" would lead to a 30-point deduction. Each of the six clubs, in that event, would also be subject to an additional $35 million fine.Read MoreLast month, UEFA opened disciplinary proceedings against Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus after the teams' involvement in the European Super League.
