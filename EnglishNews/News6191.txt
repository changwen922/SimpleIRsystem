In an interview with NBC News on Sunday, Blinken decried Russia's increased military presence on its shared border with Ukraine, and said Biden relayed that message to Putin in their virtual meeting last week. He added that the diplomatic structure that "prevents war from breaking out" could break down if Russia continues its military escalation on the Ukraine border. "One country can't dictate to another country, its choices, its decisions in its foreign policy, with whom it will associate, one country can't exert a sphere of influence over others, that's what Russia is purporting to assert. And if we let that go with impunity, then the entire system that provides for stability, prevents war from breaking out, is in danger. That's why this is so important. That's why the President's been very clear with President Putin," Blinken said.  Blinken said it's important for Biden and Putin to continue speaking directly, but stopped short of saying the White House would be open to a second in-person meeting between the two leaders and would not answer direct questions about the likelihood of one. When asked whether the administration is considering an in-person meeting, Blinken dodged and said, "The video conference is important because as much as I can do with my counterpart, as much as other colleagues in the government can do with theirs, when it comes to Russia, President Putin is the one person that really counts, and it's very important for President Biden to speak directly clearly to him so that he understands from the leader of the United States, exactly what he risks if he pursues aggression with Ukraine." Asked what it would take for Biden to agree to an in-person meeting, Blinken did not comment directly, but he said generally the United States and partners in Europe are "looking to see de-escalation. We're looking to see Russia pull back forces from the border. And we're looking to see Russia engage in good faith in diplomacy and diplomatic dialogue with the Europeans with Ukraine to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine. And to give Ukraine its border back. That's what we're looking to see."
