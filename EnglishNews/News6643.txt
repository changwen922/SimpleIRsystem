The experienced midfield of Toni Kroos, Luka Modric and Casemiro took control of the flow of the game, and it was an excellent through-ball from Kroos that enabled Real Madrid to open the scoring.Vinicius controlled the ball masterfully on his chest before firing past Alisson in the Liverpool goal.

The Reds looked better after the break and reduced the deficit six minutes into the second half as Salah profited from neat work by Georginio Wijnaldum and Diego Jota to finish past Thibaut Courtois. However, as Liverpool attempted to restore parity, sloppy passes and errant shots disrupted its flow and Real Madrid was able to extend its lead as Vinicius squeezed a first-time shot past Alisson following slick buildup play by Karim Benzema and Modric.Georginio Wijnaldum is challenged by Casemiro.'Won the ball fairly'In Tuesday's other tie, a late goal from Phil Foden helped Manchester City to a 2-1 victory over Borussia Dortmund.
