"CeCe has turned her focus towards the future and is continuing to train. She will compete on the national -- and world -- stage again soon," McFarland said.To be eligible for the trials in track and field, athletes must meet the requirements to be a member of the US Olympic Team, USATF said.

"According to subsequent notification to CeCe from World Athletics on June 22, she has not been able to demonstrate her eligibility."USATF strongly supports inclusivity and providing a clear path to participation in the sport for all, while also maintaining competitive fairness. If CeCe meets the conditions for transgender athlete participation in the future, we wholeheartedly back her participation in international events as a member of Team USATF."Telfer competed for NCAA Division II Franklin Pierce University men's track and field team for three years before medically transitioning. Competing on the women's team as a senior, Telfer won the NCAA title in the women's 400-meter hurdles in 2019. CNN's Madeline Holcombe contributed to this report.
