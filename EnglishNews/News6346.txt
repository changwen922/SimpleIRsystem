The team trained in Yanggu, Gangwon province, in August when the Icheon Training Center was closed last year in March due to Covid-19. From there, Han made five-hour round trips to Seoul every night to get treatment after training -- up until a month before he died.Battling cancer is never easy, but Han didn't want to distract the players, so he kept his condition a secret from most of the team except for captain Cho and few veteran players.When Cho found Han throwing up in his room due to the exhausting anticancer drug he had been put on, the coach told his captain to come in quickly and close the door so other players don't see him suffering in pain."Han was honest about his condition to some, but in front of others he said, 'I'm okay, everything's fine,' but he was in great pain," Cho recalled.The Ariake Arena, venue for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic volleyball and Paralympic wheelchair basketball events, during a tree planting event to commemorate the reconstruction of disaster-affected areas in Japan on June 6, 2021.Han died on September 26, 2020.
