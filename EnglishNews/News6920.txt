He criticized a video broadcast by state TV channel RT, in which various prominent figures expressed support for controversial changes to the Russian constitution. Veteran Ignat Artemenko, 94, was among those supporters. Navalny was accused of defaming the veteran.The constitutional changes, which were backed in a July 1 referendum, paved the way for Russian President Vladimir Putin to stay in office until 2036, despite having already ruled the country for two decades."Navalny knew for sure that the information he had disseminated was false and defamed reputation," the judge, Vera Akimova, said Saturday.In December 2020, the penalty for defamation was changed to include potential jail time.
