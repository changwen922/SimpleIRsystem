 (CNN)UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has reshuffled his cabinet, moving Dominic Raab from the post of foreign secretary to those of deputy prime minister and justice secretary, Downing Street announced Wednesday.Raab, who was widely criticized for his handling of the UK withdrawal from Afghanistan, was also named lord chancellor in the reshuffle at the top of Johnson's government.The former foreign secretary was on holiday in Greece as the Taliban took control of Afghanistan. He faced demands for his resignation after it emerged that not long before the fall of Kabul, he asked a deputy to handle an urgent call with the Afghan foreign minister regarding the evacuation of interpreters who had worked with British armed forces. The call never happened.Who is Dominic Raab?

"Despite the challenges of the global pandemic, I'm particularly proud of the transformational reforms I've led in Post 16 education: in further education colleges, our Skills agenda, apprenticeships and more."Williamson has been replaced as education secretary by Nadhim Zahawi, formerly vaccines minister, Downing Street confirmed in a tweet.Robert Jenrick also lost his role as minister for housing, communities and local government. He has been replaced by Michael Gove, who along with Johnson led the pro-Brexit campaign in 2016 and has held a variety of ministerial roles, most recently as minister for the Cabinet Office.Robert Buckland stepped aside as justice secretary to make way for Raab.
