 (CNN)Brazilian footballer Neymar has said that next year's FIFA World Cup in Qatar could be his last. Neymar, who has played more than 100 times for Brazil over the past 11 years, is his country's second-highest scorer of all time after Pelé and featured at the 2010 and 2014 World Cups. "I think it's my last World Cup," the 29-year-old said in a new documentary, Neymar Jr and The Line Of Kings, produced by DAZN. "I see it as my last because I don't know if I have the strength of mind to deal with football anymore."So I'll do anything to turn up well, do everything to win with my country, to realize my greatest dream since I was little. And I hope I can do it."READ: Canadian goalkeeper Stephanie Labbe's journey through panic attacks to Olympic goldRead MoreNeymar scored in Brazil's World Cup qualifying game against Peru last month.
