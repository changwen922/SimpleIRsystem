London (CNN)The organizers of a marathon in southern England have apologized after the course for Sunday's race was more than 500 meters (1,640 feet) too long.The Brighton Marathon returned to the streets of the coastal city after a pandemic-enforced break, but participants were forced to run further than the regulation 26.2 miles."We would like to apologise to our marathon participants that the course today has measured 568m too long," the organizers said on Twitter."We are wholly disappointed that this has affected our runners & hope that it hasn't marred the experience, at what has been a fantastic comeback after event after 18 months."Great North Run organizers accidentally send 5k competitors the wrong wayNeil McClements won the race with a time of 2:33:44, with Ollie Garrod in second with a time of 2:34:01.Read MoreMcClements overtook Garrod in the last 200 meters, sparking debate on Twitter."The runner who led all the way was caught with 200m to go. So basically, he was winning at the traditional marathon finish point," tweeted one user.Event director Tom Naylor explained the mistake in a statement published Monday."Despite the marathon route being measured correctly in the lead-up to race start, a basic human error in laying out a cone line meant that the final marathon course overran by 568m on the day," Naylor said."We offer our sincerest apologies for this mistake, which was only spotted once participants were on the course, and when an amendment was not possible," he added.Naylor said finishers will be given more information about their times, and the course length would be adjusted for results and qualifying times.Sunday's marathon isn't the first race to feature an accidental distance adjustment.
