 (CNN)Nneka Ogwumike of the Los Angeles Sparks and Elizabeth Williams of the Atlanta Dream won't be able to play for Nigeria in the Tokyo Olympics after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) denied their appeal.FIBA, the world governing body for basketball, had ruled that the two WNBA players could not suit up for Nigeria, as they have previously played for the US in FIBA events. Ogwumike and Williams requested CAS to provisionally change their national status from USA to Nigeria, as FIBA eligibility guidelines state a player could potentially change national teams if it's in the interest in developing the sport of basketball.The players' appeal was rejected by CAS, a FIBA statement said."Although both players had played for USA after the age of 17 and participated in the qualifying process to the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games (in February 2020 and September 2019, respectively), they recently requested an exceptional change of their national status, which FIBA declined under the applicable rules," the statement read.
