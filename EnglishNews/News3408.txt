Hamilton had all but won his record-breaking eighth world title until Williams Racing driver Nicholas Latifi crashed into the barriers with four laps remaining, resulting in the safety car being called out. It meant the race restarted on the final lap, with Verstappen allowed to start almost side-by-side Hamilton, despite the Brit having established a healthy lead.The Dutchman, on new tires, had the pace to overtake his rival and win one of the most dramatic F1 races ever.

I love working with them so much," an emotional and slightly stunned Verstappen, 24, said after the race. "Finally, today, I had a bit of luck. My team know I love them and I want to do this with them for the next 10 or 15 years!"The victory means Verstappen prevented Hamilton from surpassing the record he still shares with racing legend Michael Schumacher. Mercedes confirmed it had lodged two protests relating to the end of the race, but both were rejected by officials later on Sunday. The team then lodged an intention to appeal against the decision relating to restarting the race for the last lap.

The Dutchman took the early advantage by qualifying in pole position after a magical qualifying lap on Saturday, a drive that will be remembered for quite some time. But it was Hamilton who started the race better from second, overtaking Verstappen before the first corner and dominating the majority of the Grand Prix with the Mercedes pace. There was controversy, as there has been throughout the season, with Red Bull adamant that Hamilton should have given his first place back to Verstappen after the Mercedes man went off the track following contact with his rival.  Stewards, however, decided not to investigate the incident and allowed Hamilton to proceed in first.Red Bull then resorted to its Plan B, with Verstappen's teammate Sergio PÃ©rez expertly holding up Hamilton after the Mercedes driver emerged from the pit lane in second. The Brit finally found a way past the Red Bull but not until he had Verstappen back on his heels. But Hamilton looked to have done enough, building up a double-digit second lead, and was cruising to victory before the mayhem of the final lap. With the win, Verstappen finished the season on 395.5 points, while Hamilton finished second on 387.5.READ: Hamilton praised for defending LGBTI rights during F1 Qatar Grand PrixVerstappen is congratulated by Lewis Hamilton after the race.
