 (CNN)The sale and carrying of plastic bottles is to be banned in French stadiums from July 2022, the French government announced Thursday in a statement. The move is part of measures to limit violence from fans against players or staff on the pitch during matches. Clubs will be able to put the measure in place from today, if they so wish, a statement from the ministers of interior, justice and sport said. It added that the French Football Federation has announced its desire to apply the rule for the next match of the national team. The ministers agreed that when a player or referee is injured on the pitch by a projectile from the stands, as a rule the match in question will be completely stopped, the statement said.
