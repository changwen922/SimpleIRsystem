Rusty Bowers, but the Arizona House speaker has quietly made a name for himself in the state as the stealth killer of his party's most extreme election ideas.First up was a bill that would have ripped up most voting rules in this battleground state and handed the state legislature the power to reject election results it didn't like. In a bit of parliamentary jiu jitsu, Bowers assigned the bill to 12 committees at once, ensuring it would go nowhere. Its sponsor, GOP state Rep. John Fillmore, called it a "12-committee lynching."Arizona Mirror journalist Jeremy Duda offered a colorful take -- describing Bowers' takedown as "killing the bill, chopping it up, setting the pieces on fire, then digging up the ashes and throwing them into the ocean."Read MoreThen came Rep. Mark Finchem's resolution this month on Arizona's 2020 election results. Finchem, a Republican running for secretary of state this year with Trump's endorsement, makes mostly debunked claims of fraud to call for the results to be set aside in three counties. It includes Maricopa, the state's most populous county, targeted last year in a problem-plagued ballot review ordered by Republicans in the state Senate.Bowers' response to the proposal, per The Arizona Republic: "Mr. Finchem's obviously unconstitutional and profoundly unwise proposal will receive all of the consideration it deserves."Bowers, a professional painter and sculptor who represents a district east of Phoenix, has a contrarian history -- at least when it comes to some of his party's most outlandish maneuvers in recent years.He has described Trump and the then-President's lawyer Rudy Giuliani calling him after the 2020 election, asking Bowers to somehow inject the legislature into the certification process before the state sent its slate of 11 presidential electors to Congress.Bowers told CNN's Dianne Gallagher that he voted and campaigned for Trump but rebuffed that. "I said, 'No, I won't,'" Bowers recounted in a CNN interview last year, adding, "'3.5 million people voted here, I'm not gonna unilaterally do that.'"Bowers is term-limited in the Arizona House, and last week announced plans to run for the state Senate.Arizona at ground zeroEven as headline-grabbing election bills falter in Arizona, Republican lawmakers still are weighing a raft of proposals that could alter voting practices in a battleground state that President Joe Biden won by fewer than 11,000 votes.They include bills that would:Allow a third-party to scour the voter registration database for ineligible votersMake it a crime to misplace a ballotRestrict the use of ballot drop boxesMake it a felony for a public official to register someone to vote on the same day as election dayCreate a new election integrity unit to investigate voter fraudA database maintained by the National Conference of State Legislatures shows that Arizona accounts for nearly 10% of all the election-related bills in states this year.Alex Gulotta, a voting rights activist who runs the Arizona branch of All Voting is Local, said he credits Bowers with "holding the line" to block some of the most blatantly undemocratic ideas floated in the state.But, he said, "there are actually a lot of bad things" moving through the legislature "that people are being silent about."Dates to watchThe stakes are high in Arizona this year.Voters will fill an open gubernatorial seat, now held by term-limited Republican Gov.
