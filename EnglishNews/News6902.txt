 (CNN)Control of both chambers of Congress and dozens of governorships and state offices are on the line in 2022, the first national election since President Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump, who is using the campaign to tighten his grip on the Republican Party.Democrats are on the defensive in Washington, where they face an uphill battle to maintain or grow their narrow majorities in the House and Senate. Republicans, meanwhile, believe they are well-positioned to capitalize on frustration over the ongoing pandemic and bring divided government to the US Capitol in 2023.As the primary calendar heats up, both parties are also poised for intense internal fights over their political directions.Democrats are in the midst of a familiar but pointed debate between rival party factions that has been crystallized by the party's failure, so far, to pass the centerpiece of Biden's agenda.
