 (CNN)Belarus has struck back against the United States, slashing the number of staff permitted at the US embassy in Minsk, in response to sanctions imposed on some of its state-owned enterprises.In a statement announcing the move on Thursday, the Belarusian Foreign Ministry said it was reducing the number of both "diplomatic and administrative-technical" staff at the embassy, without specifying the number of staff that will be affected. The ministry's press secretary Anatoly Glaz said that in addition to the staff reduction, Belarus will also tighten visa procedures and revoke permission for USAID to work in the country.
