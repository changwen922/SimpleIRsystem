Their descendants started settling on Cyprus from the 8th century onwards.The Pope also called on the European continent to find a way to move forward, saying it needs "reconciliation and unity.""For it will not be the walls of fear and the vetoes dictated by nationalist interests that ensure its progress, nor will economic recovery alone serve to guarantee its security and stability."The Pope will be staying at the Vatican embassy in Cyprus' capital Nicosia, which sits right on the dividing line that resulted from a Turkish invasion that was triggered by a 1974 coup sponsored by the military junta that controlled Greece at the time.A church in the compound that houses the embassy still bears scars from the crossfire.The northern part of the island, including a section of its capital, is controlled by a Turkish Cypriot administration recognized only by Turkey as an independent state.Francis, who shuns large, bulletproof cars, traveled in a small black Fiat 500 with open windows. He was greeted with cheers and applause as the vehicle navigated the capital's narrow streets.
