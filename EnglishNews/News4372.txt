Now, Sophie, the Countess of Wessex and the Queen's daughter-in-law, is speaking about another deeply personal issue riddled with stigma.Fifty-six-year-old Sophie first drew attention to the subject of menopause back in May, when she described the transition as feeling like someone had taken her brain out. "When we're told that we're going to begin our periods, are we actually told that we're going to end them as well?" she said during a video call for the charity Wellbeing of Women.It was the first time a member of the royal family had openly shared her experience of periods and menopause. You don't expect royals to speak personally about these subjects, especially in such frank detail, given how private the family is. So when they do, it's all the more powerful.Sophie, Countess of Wessex during a visit to the Autumn RHS Chelsea Flower Show in London on September 20, 2021And this week, Sophie issued a call to action. She wants businesses to do more to support women going through the menopause, which often happens at a point in their lives when their careers should be peaking.Wellbeing of Women says around 900,000 women have quit their jobs in the UK due to the menopause, something Sophie described as "tragic."Read MoreShe backed a campaign pressing employers to sign the Menopause Workplace Pledge, which aims to "make sure everyone going through the menopause is supported."The countess said: "We are fabulous in our 40s, we are even more fabulous in our 50s, 60s and 70s and we need to celebrate that and keep those opportunities going for women.""We cannot let anybody leave that workforce unfulfilled, and also feeling that they have got to slope off into the shadows. It's not right and we've got to be able to change that."Most women experience menopause symptoms.

Those who are suffering from it may not realize what is happening to them, and even if they do they will often be too embarrassed to admit it. Sophie hopes that by opening up herself, others will be encouraged to do so but also that they will get a sympathetic response from bosses so it doesn't have to be career-ending.Since Prince Harry, Meghan and Prince Andrew stepped back from their senior royal positions, Sophie and husband Edward have stepped up and been given more high-profile roles. Both are using it to highlight causes and interests that matter to them and we're learning more about them all the time.WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING?Queen sends Commonwealth Games baton on epic global adventure.The monarch was all smiles for her first public engagement since returning to London from her summer vacation. Joined by her youngest son, the Earl of Wessex, for the first major event to be held at Buckingham Palace since the pandemic, Queen Elizabeth donned a fabulously bold orange coat and matching hat to present the baton to the first batonbearer, British Paralympic athlete Kadeena Cox on Thursday. The relay -- which is traditionally held in the lead up to the Commonwealth Games -- is set to last a whopping 294 days, traveling through 72 Commonwealth nations and territories. It will cover a spectacular 90,000 miles before ending its journey back in the UK at the opening ceremony of the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games next July. Not only will it travel far and wide, but the baton itself is no joke. Constructed from steel, aluminum and copper, it also holds a strand of platinum (a nod to the jubilee next year) and features a 360-degree camera, heart rate monitor, atmospheric sensors and LED lighting. And locked within the baton is a message from the Queen to the Commonwealth, which will be read at the opening festivities. The baton's first stop after leaving the UK will be Cyprus, then Malta.The Queen and Earl of Wessex are Patron and Vice-Patron of the Commonwealth Games Federation, respectively. Prince Andrew's legal team to get confidential document they think will end Giuffre civil suit.n the latest move in the ongoing legal tussle, a US judge has agreed to give the Duke of York's lawyers access to a 2009 sealed agreement between Virginia Giuffre and Jeffrey Epstein. At the first pre-trial hearing in September, Andrew's attorney argued the document should be disclosed as it could negate the current case. "We believe, however, that this is a baseless, non-viable and potentially unlawful lawsuit that plaintiff has filed against the Duke. There has been a settlement agreement that the plaintiff has entered into in a prior action that releases the Duke and others from any and all potential liability," Andrew Brettler said. Giuffre's lawyer, David Boies, called the confidential agreement "irrelevant" at the same hearing last month, but this week wrote a letter to the judge asking for it to be handed over.

Kate stopped by University College London's Centre for Longitudinal Studies on Tuesday to meet researchers behind "The Children of the 2020s" study. It's set to monitor the holistic development of children in England between the ages of nine months and five years. Academics will soon start enlisting the help of up to 8,000 families and will explore the myriad factors that can affect a child's early development, from home environment, to community, to early years services and broader social and economic circumstances. "Our early childhoods shape our adult lives and knowing more about what impacts this critical time is fundamental to understanding what we as a society can do to improve our future health and happiness," Catherine said ahead of her visit, adding: "The landmark 'Children of the 2020s' study will illustrate the importance of the first five years and provide insights into the most critical aspects of early childhood, as well as the factors which support or hinder positive lifelong outcomes." Kensington Palace said the engagement was the first of many the duchess plans to make in relation to the study. The critical role early childhood plays in lifelong outcomes has long been a subject close to Kate's heart. Her decade-long work on the subject culminated in the creation of her own Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood in June.Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge during her visit to University College London's Centre for Longitudinal StudiesDID YOU KNOW?Beatrice's choice of baby name honors the Queen.Princess Beatrice, the elder daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York, has revealed the name of her first child -- and it includes a touching tribute to the baby's great-grandmother, the Queen.

FROM THE ROYAL VAULTLeft to right: Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge; Diana, Princess of Wales; and Meghan, Duchess of SussexIn anticipation of the new CNN documentary on the late Princess of Wales, CNN Style's Meghan C. Hills has been digging into Diana's influence in the lives of her daughters-in-law. Both Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex are known to be trendsetters in their own rights. But they also borrow from the lookbook first presented by their spouses' mother back in the day. Hills highlights that both duchesses have combined elements of some of Diana's most famous outfits into their own wardrobes. With Kate, for instance, that's been in the use of Peter Pan collars and pussy bow blouses, while for Meghan it has translated to sharp tailoring and fitted dresses.
